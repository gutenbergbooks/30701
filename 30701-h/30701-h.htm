<h2>The Louis Clark Vanuxem Foundation
of Princeton University</h2>

  <p>was established in 1912 with a bequest of $25,000 under the will of
  Louis Clark Vanuxem, of the Class of 1879. By direction of the executors
  of Mr. Vanuxem's estate, the income of the foundation is to be used for a
  series of public lectures delivered in Princeton annually, at least one
  half of which shall be on subjects of current scientific interest. The
  lectures are to be published and distributed among schools and libraries
  generally.</p>

  <p>The following lectures have already been published or are in
  press:</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>Occasionally one hears today the statement that we have come to
  realize that we know nothing about evolution. This point of view is a
  healthy reaction to the over-confident belief that we knew everything
  about evolution. There are even those rash enough to think that in the
  last few years we have learned more about evolution than we might have
  hoped to know a few years ago. A <i>critique</i> therefore not only
  becomes a criticism of the older evidence but an appreciation of the new
  evidence.</p>

  <p>In the first lecture an attempt is made to put a new valuation on the
  traditional evidence for evolution. In the second lecture the most recent
  work on heredity is dealt with, for only characters that are inherited
  can become a part <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>of the evolutionary process. In the third
  lecture the physical basis of heredity and the composition of the germ
  plasm stream are examined in the light of new observations; while in the
  fourth lecture the thesis is developed that chance variation combined
  with a property of living things to manifold themselves is the key note
  of modern evolutionary thought.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">A REVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION WAS BASED</p>

  <p>We use the word evolution in many ways&mdash;to include many different
  kinds of changes. There is hardly any other scientific term that is used
  so carelessly&mdash;to imply so much, to mean so little.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Three Kinds of Evolution</span></p>

  <p>We speak of the evolution of the stars, of the evolution of the horse,
  of the evolution of the steam engine, as though they were all part of the
  same process. What have they in common? Only this, that each concerns
  itself with the <i>history</i> of something. When the astronomer thinks
  of the <i>evolution</i> of the earth, the moon, the sun and the stars, he
  has a picture of diffuse matter that has slowly condensed. With
  condensation came heat; with heat, action and <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>reaction within the mass
  until the chemical substances that we know today were produced. This is
  the nebular hypothesis of the astronomer. The astronomer explains, or
  tries to explain, how this evolution took place, by an appeal to the
  physical processes that have been worked out in the laboratory, processes
  which he thinks have existed through all the eons during which this
  evolution was going on and which were its immediate causes.</p>

  <p>When the biologist thinks of the evolution of animals and plants, a
  different picture presents itself. He thinks of series of animals that
  have lived in the past, whose bones (fig. 1) and shells have been
  preserved in the rocks. He thinks of these animals as having in the past
  given birth, through an unbroken succession of individuals, to the living
  inhabitants of the earth today. He thinks that the old, simpler types of
  the past have in part changed over into the more complex forms of
  today.</p>

  <p>He is thinking as the historian thinks, but he sometimes gets confused
  and thinks that he is explaining evolution when he is only describing it.

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span></p>

  <p>A third kind of evolution is one for which man himself is responsible,
  in the sense that he has brought it about, often with a definite end in
  view.</p>

  <p>His mind has worked slowly from stage to stage. We can often trace the
  history of the stages through which his psychic processes have passed.
  The evolution of the steam-boat, the steam engine, paintings, clothing,
  instruments of agriculture, of manufacture, or of warfare (fig. 2)
  illustrates the history of human progress. There is an obvious and
  striking similarity between the evolution of man's inventions and the
  evolution of the shells of molluscs and of the bones of mammals, yet in
  neither case does a knowledge of the order in which these things arose
  explain them. If we appeal to the psychologist he will probably tell us
  that human inventions are either the result of happy accidents, that have
  led to an unforeseen, but discovered use; or else the use of the
  invention was foreseen. It is to the latter process more especially that
  the idea of <i>purpose</i> is applied. When we come to review the four
  great lines of evolutionary thought we <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>shall see that this human
  idea of purpose recurs in many forms, suggesting that man has often tried
  to explain how organic evolution has taken place by an appeal to the
  method which he believes he makes use of himself in the inorganic
  world.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">
      <a href="images/fig_002.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_002.jpg"

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span></p>

  <p>What has the evolution of the stars, of the horse and of human
  inventions in common? Only this, that in each case from a simple
  beginning through a series of changes something more complex, or at least
  different, has come into being. To lump all these kinds of changes into
  one and call them evolution is no more than asserting that you believe in
  consecutive series of events (which is history) causally connected (which
  is science); that is, that you believe in history and that you believe in
  science. But let us not forget that we may have complete faith in both
  without thereby offering any explanation of either. It is the business of
  science to find out <i>specifically</i> what kinds of events were
  involved when the stars evolved in the sky, when the horse evolved on the
  earth, and the steam engine was evolved from the mind of man.</p>

  <p>Is it not rather an empty generalization to say that any kind of
  change is a process of evolution? At most it means little more than that
  you want to intimate that miraculous <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>intervention is not
  necessary to account for such kinds of histories.</p>

  <p>We are concerned here more particularly with the biologists' ideas of
  evolution. My intention is to review the evidence on which the old theory
  rested its case, in the light of some of the newer evidence of recent
  years.</p>

  <p>Four great branches of study have furnished the evidence of organic
  evolution. They are:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Comparative anatomy.</p>
      <p>Embryology.</p>
      <p>Paleontology.</p>
      <p>Experimental Breeding or Genetics.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Comparative Anatomy</i></p>

  <p>When we study animals and plants we find that they can be arranged in
  groups according to their resemblances. This is the basis of comparative
  anatomy, which is only an accurate study of facts that are superficially
  obvious to everyone.</p>

  <p>The groups are based not on a single difference, but on a very large
  number of resemblances. Let us take for example the group of vertebrates.

  <p>The hand and the arm of man are similar to the hand and arm of the

  horse and the opossum. We can identify the same parts in the forefoot of
  the lizard, the frog (fig. 3), and even, though less certainly, in the
  pectoral fins of fishes. Comparison does not end here. We find
  similarities in the skull and back bones of these same animals; in the
  brain; in the digestive system; in the heart and blood vessels; in the
  muscles.</p>

  <p>Each of these systems is very complex, but <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>the same general
  arrangement is found in all. Anyone familiar with the evidence will, I
  think, probably reach the conclusion either that these animals have been
  created on some preconceived plan, or else that they have some other bond
  that unites them; for we find it difficult to believe that such complex,
  yet similar things could have arisen independently. But we try to
  convince our students of the truth of the theory of evolution not so much
  by calling their attention to this relation as by tracing each organ from
  a simple to a complex structure.</p>

  <p>I have never known such a course to fail in its intention. In fact, I
  know that the student often becomes so thoroughly convinced that he
  resents any such attempt as that which I am about to make to point out
  that the evidence for his conviction is not above criticism.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Because we can often arrange the series of structures in a line
  extending from the very simple to the more complex, we are apt to become
  unduly impressed by this fact and conclude that if we found the complete
  series we should find all the intermediate steps and that they have
  arisen in the order of their <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>complexity. This conclusion is not
  necessarily correct. Let me give some examples that have come under my
  own observation. We have bred for five years the wild fruit fly
  Drosophila ampelophila (fig. 4) and we have found over a hundred and
  twenty-five new types that breed true. Each has arisen independently and
  suddenly. Every part of the body has been affected by one or another of
  these mutations. For instance many different kinds of changes have <!--
  Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>taken
  place in the wings and several of these involve the size of the wings. If
  we arrange the latter arbitrarily in the order of their size there will
  be an almost complete series beginning with the normal wings and ending
  with those of apterous flies. Several of these types are represented in
  figure 5. The order in which these mutations occurred bears no relation
  to their size; each originated independently from the wild type.</p>

    apterous.</p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

  <p>The wings of the wild fly are straight (fig. 4). Several types have
  arisen in which the wings are bent upwards and in the most extreme type
  the wings are curled over the back, as seen in figure 54 (g), yet there
  is no historical connection between these stages.</p>

  <p>Mutations have occurred involving the pigmentation of the body and
  wings. The head and thorax of the wild Drosophila ampelophila are grayish
  yellow, the abdomen is banded with yellow and black, and the wings are
  gray. There have appeared in our cultures several kinds of darker types
  ranging to almost black flies (fig. 20) and to lighter types that are
  quite yellow. If put in line a series may be made from the darkest flies
  at one end to the light yellow flies at the other. These types, with the
  fluctuations that occur within each type, furnish a complete series of
  gradations; yet historically they have arisen independently of each
  other.</p>

  <p>Many changes in eye color have appeared. As many as thirty or more
  races differing in eye <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>color are now maintained in our cultures.
  Some of them are so similar that they can scarcely be separated from each
  other. It is easily possible beginning with the darkest eye color, sepia,
  which is deep brown, to pick out a perfectly graded series ending with
  pure white eyes. But such a serial arrangement would give a totally false
  idea of the way the different types have arisen; and any conclusion based
  on the existence of such a series might very well be entirely erroneous,
  for the fact that such a series exists bears no relation to the order in
  which its members have appeared.</p>

  <p>Suppose that evolution "in the open" had taken place in the same way,
  by means of <i>discontinuous</i> variation. What value then would the
  evidence from comparative anatomy have in so far as it is based on a
  continuous series of variants of any organ?</p>

  <p>No one familiar with the entire evidence will doubt for a moment that
  these 125 races of Drosophila ampelophila belong to the same species and
  have had a common origin, for while they may differ mainly in one thing
  they are extremely alike in a hundred other things, and <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>in the general
  relation of the parts to each other.</p>

  <p>It is in this sense that the evidence from comparative anatomy can be
  used I think as an argument for evolution. It is the resemblances that
  the animals or plants in any group have in common that is the basis for
  such a conclusion; it is not because we can arrange in a continuous
  series any particular variations. In other words, our inference
  concerning the common descent of two or more species is based on the
  totality of such resemblances that still remain in large part after each
  change has taken place. In this sense the argument from comparative
  anatomy, while not a demonstration, carries with it, I think, a high
  degree of probability.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Embryology</i></p>

  <p>In passing from the egg to the adult the individual goes through a
  series of changes. In the course of this development we see not only the
  beginnings of the organs that gradually enlarge and change into those of
  the adult animal, but also see that organs appear and <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>later disappear
  before the adult stage is reached. We find, moreover, that the young
  sometimes resemble in a most striking way the adult stage of groups that
  we place lower in the scale of evolution.</p>

  <p>Many years before Darwin advanced his theory of evolution through
  natural selection, the resemblance of the young of higher animals to the
  adults of lower animals had attracted the attention of zoölogists and
  various views, often very naïve, had been advanced to account for the
  resemblance. Among these speculations there was one practically identical
  with that adopted by Darwin and the post-Darwinians, namely that the
  higher animals repeat in their development the <i>adult stages</i> of
  lower animals. Later this view became one of the cornerstones of the
  theory of organic evolution. It reached its climax in the writings of
  Haeckel, and I think I may add without exaggeration that for twenty-five
  years it furnished the chief inspiration of the school of descriptive
  embryology. Today it is taught in practically all textbooks of biology.
  Haeckel called this interpretation the Biogenetic Law. <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span></p>

  <p>It was recognized, of course, that many embryonic stages could not
  possibly represent ancestral animals. A young fish with a huge yolk sac
  attached (fig. 6) could scarcely ever have led a happy, free life as an
  adult individual. Such stages were interpreted, however, as
  <i>embryonic</i> additions to the original ancestral type. The embryo had
  done something on its own account.</p>

  <p>In some animals the young have structures that attach them to the
  mother, as does the placenta of the mammals. In other cases the young
  develop membranes about themselves&mdash;like the amnion of the chick
  (fig. 7) and mammal&mdash;that would have shut off an adult animal from
  all intercourse with the outside <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>world. Hundreds of such embryonic
  adaptations are known to embryologists. These were explained as
  adaptations and as falsifications of the ancestral records.</p>

    showing relations of amnion, allantois and yolk. (After Lillie.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>At the end of the last century Weismann injected a new idea into our
  views concerning the origin of variations. He urged that variations are
  germinal, i.e. they first appear in the egg and the sperm as changes that
  later bring about modifications in the individual. The idea has been
  fruitful and is generally accepted by most biologists today. It means
  that the <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>offspring of a pair of animals are not
  affected by the structure or the activities of their parents, but the
  germ plasm is the unmodified stream from which both the parent and the
  young have arisen. Hence their resemblance. Now, it has been found that a
  variation arising in the germ plasm, no matter what its cause, may affect
  any stage in the development of the next individuals that arise from it.
  There is no reason to suppose that such a change produces a new character
  that always sticks itself, as it were, on to the end of the old series.
  This idea of germinal variation therefore carried with it the death of
  the older conception of evolution by superposition.</p>

  <p>In more recent times another idea has become current, mainly due to
  the work of Bateson and of de Vries&mdash;the idea that variations are
  discontinuous. Such a conception does not fall easily into line with the
  statement of the biogenetic "law"; for actual experience with
  discontinuous variation has taught us that new characters that arise do
  not add themselves to the end of the line of already existing characters
  but if they affect the adult characters <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>they change them without,
  as it were, passing through and beyond them.</p>

  <p>I venture to think that these new ideas and this new evidence have
  played havoc with the biogenetic "law". Nevertheless, there is an
  interpretation of the facts that is entirely <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>compatible with the
  theory of evolution. Let me illustrate this by an example.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig_010.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_010.jpg"

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span> Young fish, dorsal
    view, and side view, showing gill slits. (After Kopsch.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The embryos of the chick (fig. 8) and of man (fig. 9) possess at an
  early stage in their development gill-slits on the sides of the neck like
  those of fishes. No one familiar with the relations of the parts will for
  a moment doubt that the gill slits of these embryos and of the fish
  represent the same structures. When we look further into the matter we
  find that young fish also possess gill slits (fig. 10 and 11)&mdash;even
  in young stages in their development. Is it not <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>then more probable that
  the mammal and bird possess this stage in their development simply
  because it has never been lost? Is not this a more reasonable view than
  to suppose that the gill slits of the embryos of the higher forms
  represent the adult gill slits of the fish that in some mysterious way
  have been pushed back into the embryo of the bird?</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span> Side views of head of
    embryo sharks, showing gill slits.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I could give many similar examples. All can be interpreted as
  embryonic survivals rather than as phyletic contractions. Not one of them
  calls for the latter interpretation.</p>

  <p>The study of the cleavage pattern of the segmenting egg furnishes the
  most convincing evidence that a different explanation from the one stated
  in the biogenetic law is the more probable explanation. <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>

  </div>

  <p>It has been found that the cleavage pattern has the same general
  arrangement in the early stages of flat worms, annelids and molluscs
  (fig. 12). Obviously these stages have never been adult ancestors, and
  obviously if their resemblance has any meaning at all, it is that each
  group has retained the same general plan <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>of cleavage, possessed by
  their common ancestor.</p>

  <p>Accepting this view, let us ask, does the evidence from embryology
  favor the theory of evolution? I think that it does very strongly. The
  embryos of the mammal, bird, and lizard have gill slits today because
  gill slits were present in the embryos of their ancestors. There is no
  other view that explains so well their presence in the higher forms.</p>

  <p>Perhaps someone will say, Well! is not this all that we have contended
  for! Have you not reached the old conclusion in a roundabout way? I think
  not. To my mind there is a wide difference between the old statement that
  the higher animals living today have the original adult stages telescoped
  into their embryos, and the statement that the resemblance between
  certain characters in the embryos of higher animals and corresponding
  stages in the embryos of lower animals is most plausibly explained by the
  assumption that they have descended from the same ancestors, and that
  their common structures are embryonic survivals. <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Paleontology</i></p>

  <p>The direct evidence furnished by fossil remains is by all odds the
  strongest evidence that we have in favor of organic evolution.
  Paleontology holds the incomparable position of being able to point
  directly to the evidence showing that the animals and plants living in
  past times are connected with those living at the present time, often
  through an unbroken series of stages. Paleontology has triumphed over the
  weakness of the evidence, which Darwin admitted was serious, by filling
  in many of the missing links.</p>

  <p>Paleontology has been criticised on the ground that she cannot pretend
  to show the actual ancestors of living forms because, if in the past
  genera and species were as abundant and as diverse as we find them at
  present, it is very improbable that the bones of any individual that
  happened to be preserved are the bones of just that species that took
  part in the evolution. Paleontologists will freely admit that in many
  cases this is probably true, but even then the evidence is, I think,
  still just as valuable and <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>in exactly the same sense as is the evidence
  from comparative anatomy. It suffices to know that there lived in the
  past a particular "group" of animals that had many points in common with
  those that preceded them and with those that came later. Whether these
  are the actual ancestors or not does not so much matter, for the view
  that from such a group of species the later species have been derived is
  far more probable than any other view that has been proposed.</p>

  <p>With this unrivalled material and splendid series of gradations,
  paleontology has constructed many stages in the past history of the
  globe. But paleontologists have sometimes gone beyond this descriptive
  phase of the subject and have attempted to formulate the "causes", "laws"
  and "principles" that have led to the development of their series. It has
  even been claimed that paleontologists are in an incomparably better
  position than zoölogists to discover such principles, because they know
  both the beginning and the end of the evolutionary series. The retort is
  obvious. In his sweeping and poetic vision the paleontologist may fail
  completely to find out the nature of <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>the pigments that have
  gone into the painting of his picture, and he may confuse a familiarity
  with the different views he has enjoyed of the canvas with a knowledge of
  how the painting is being done.</p>

  <p>My good friend the paleontologist is in greater danger than he
  realizes, when he leaves descriptions and attempts explanation. He has no
  way to check up his speculations and it is notorious that the human mind
  without control has a bad habit of wandering.</p>

  <p>When the modern student of variation and heredity&mdash;the
  geneticist&mdash;looks over the different "continuous" series, from which
  certain "laws" and "principles" have been deduced, he is struck by two
  facts: that the gaps, in some cases, are enormous as compared with the
  single changes with which he is familiar, and (what is more important)
  that they involve numerous parts in many ways. The geneticist says to the
  paleontologist, since you do not know, and from the nature of your case
  can never know, whether your differences are due to one change or to a
  thousand, you can not with certainty tell us anything about the
  hereditary units <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>which have made the process of evolution
  possible. And without this knowledge there can be no understanding of the
  causes of evolution.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE FOUR GREAT HISTORICAL SPECULATIONS</p>

  <p>Looking backward over the history of the evolution theory we recognize
  that during the hundred and odd years that have elapsed since Buffon,
  there have been four main lines of <i>speculation</i> concerning
  evolution. We might call them the four great cosmogonies or the four
  modern epics of evolution.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Environment</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Geoffroy St. Hilaire</i></p>

  <p>About the beginning of the last century Geoffroy St. Hilaire, protégé,
  and in some respects a disciple of Buffon, was interested as to how
  living species are related to the animals and plants that had preceded
  them. He was familiar with the kind of change that takes place in the
  embryo if it is put into new or changed surroundings, and from this
  knowledge he concluded that as the surface of the <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>earth slowly
  changed&mdash;as the carbon dioxide contents in the air altered&mdash;as
  land appeared&mdash;and as marine animals left the water to inhabit it,
  they or their embryos responded to the new conditions and those that
  responded favorably gave rise to new creations. As the environment
  changed the fauna and flora changed&mdash;change for change. Here we have
  a picture of progressive evolution that carries with it an idea of
  mechanical necessity. If there is anything mystical or even improbable in
  St. Hilaire's argument it does not appear on the surface; for he did not
  assume that the response to the new environment was always a favorable
  one or, as we say, an adaptation. He expressly stated that <i>if</i> the
  response was unfavorable the individual or the race died out. He assumed
  that <i>sometimes</i> the change might be favorable, i.e., that certain
  species, entire groups, would respond in a direction favorable to their
  existence in a new environment and these would come to inherit the earth.
  In this sense he anticipated certain phases of the natural selection
  theory of Darwin, but only in part; for his picture is not one of strife
  within and without <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>the species, but rather the escape of the
  species from the old into a new world.</p>

  <p>If then we recognize the intimate bond in chemical constitution of
  living things and of the world in which they develop, what is there
  improbable in St. Hilaire's hypothesis? Why, in a word is not more credit
  given to St. Hilaire in modern evolutionary thought? The reasons are to
  be found, I think, first, in that the evidence to which he appealed was
  meagre and inconclusive; and, second, in that much of his special
  evidence does not seem to us to be applicable. For example the monstrous
  forms that development often assumes in a strange environment, and with
  which every embryologist is only too familiar, rarely if ever furnish
  combinations, as he supposed, that are capable of living. On the
  contrary, they lead rather to the final catastrophe of the organism. And
  lastly, St. Hilaire's appeal to sudden and great transformations, such as
  a crocodile's egg hatching into a bird, has exposed his view to too easy
  ridicule.</p>

  <p>But when all is said, St. Hilaire's conception of evolution contains
  elements that form the <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>background of our thinking to-day, for taken
  broadly, the interaction between the organism and its environment was a
  mechanistic conception of evolution even though the details of the theory
  were inadequate to establish his contention.</p>

  <p>In our own time the French metaphysician Bergson in his <i>Evolution
  Creatrice</i> has proposed in mystical form a thought that has at least a
  superficial resemblance to St. Hilaire's conception. The response of
  living things is no longer hit in one species and miss in another; it is
  precise, exact; yet not mechanical in the sense at least in which we
  usually employ the word mechanical. For Bergson claims that the one chief
  feature of living material is that it responds favorably to the situation
  in which it finds itself; at least so far as lies within the possible
  physical limitations of its organization. Evolution has followed no
  preordained plan; it has had no creator; it has brought about its own
  creation by responding adaptively to each situation as it arose.</p>

  <p>But note: the man of science believes that the organism responds today
  as it does, because at <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>present it has a chemical and physical
  constitution that gives this response. We find a specific chemical
  composition and generally a specific physical structure already existing.
  We have no reason to suppose that such particular reactions would take
  place until a specific chemical configuration had been acquired. Where
  did this constitution come from? This is the question that the scientist
  asks himself. I suppose Bergson would have to reply that it came into
  existence at the moment that the first specific stimulus was applied. But
  if this is the answer we have passed at once from the realm of
  observation to the realm of fancy&mdash;to a realm that is foreign to our
  experience; for such a view assumes that chemical and physical reactions
  are guided by the needs of the organism when the reactions take place
  inside living beings.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Use and Disuse</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From Lamarck to Weismann</i></p>

  <p>The second of the four great historical explanations appeals to a
  change not immediately connected with the outer world, but to one within
  the organism itself. <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span></p>

  <p>Practice makes perfect is a familiar adage. Not only in human affairs
  do we find that a part through use becomes a better tool for performing
  its task, and through disuse degenerates; but in the field of animal
  behavior we find that many of the most essential types of behavior have
  been learned through repeated associations formed by contact with the
  outside.</p>

  <p>It was not so long ago that we were taught that the instincts of
  animals are the inherited experience of their ancestors&mdash;lapsed
  intelligence was the current phrase.</p>

  <p>Lamarck's name is always associated with the application of the theory
  of the inheritance of acquired characters. Darwin fully endorsed this
  view and made use of it as an explanation in all of his writings about
  animals. Today the theory has few followers amongst trained
  investigators, but it still has a popular vogue that is widespread and
  vociferous.</p>

  <p>To Weismann more than to any other single individual should be
  ascribed the disfavor into which this view has fallen. In a series of
  brilliant essays he laid bare the inadequacy of the supposed evidence on
  which the inheritance of <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>acquired characters rested. Your neighbor's
  cat, for instance, has a short tail, and it is said that it had its tail
  pinched off by a closing door. In its litter of kittens one or more is
  found without a tail. Your neighbor believes that here is a case of cause
  and effect. He may even have known that the mother and grandmother of the
  cat had natural tails. But it has been found that short tail is a
  dominant character; therefore, until we know who was the father of the
  short-tailed kittens the accident to its mother and the normal condition
  of her maternal ancestry is not to the point.</p>

  <p>Weismann appealed to common sense. He made few experiments to disprove
  Lamarck's hypothesis. True, he cut off the tails of some mice for a few
  generations but got no tailless offspring and while he gives no exact
  measurements with coefficients of error he did not observe that the tails
  of the descendants had shortened one whit. The combs of fighting cocks
  and the tails of certain breeds of sheep have been cropped for many
  generations and the practice continues today, because their tails are
  still long. While in Lamarck's time there <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>was no evidence opposed
  to his ingenious theory, based as it was on an appeal to the acknowledged
  facts of improvement that take place in the organs of an individual
  through their own functioning (a fact that is as obvious and remarkable
  today as in the time of Lamarck), yet now there is evidence as to whether
  the effects of use and disuse are inherited, and this evidence is not in
  accord with Lamarck's doctrine.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE UNFOLDING PRINCIPLE</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Nägeli and Bateson</i></p>

  <p>I have ventured to put down as one of the four great historical
  explanations, under the heading of the unfolding principle, a conception
  that has taken protean forms. At one extreme it is little more than a
  mystic sentiment to the effect that evolution is the result of an inner
  driving force or principle which goes under many names such as
  Bildungstrieb, nisus formativus, vital force, and orthogenesis.
  Evolutionary thought is replete with variants of this idea, often naïvely
  expressed, sometimes unconsciously implied. Evolution once meant, in <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>fact, an
  unfolding of what pre-existed in the egg, and the term still carries with
  it something of its original significance.</p>

  <p>Nägeli's speculation written several years after Darwin's "Origin of
  Species" may be taken as a typical case. Nägeli thought that there exists
  in living material an innate power to grow and expand. He vehemently
  protested that he meant only a mechanical principle but as he failed to
  refer such a principle to any properties of matter known to physicists
  and chemists his view seems still a mysterious affirmation, as difficult
  to understand as the facts themselves which it purports to explain.</p>

  <p>Nägeli compared the process of evolution to the growth of a tree,
  whose ultimate twigs represent the living world of species. Natural
  selection plays only the rôle of the gardener who prunes the tree into
  this or that shape but who has himself <i>produced</i> nothing. As an
  imaginative figure of speech Nägeli's comparison of the tree might even
  today seem to hold if we substituted "mutations" for "growth", but
  although we know so little about what causes mutations there is no reason
  for <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>supposing them to be due to an inner
  impulse, and hence they furnish no justification for such a
  hypothesis.</p>

  <p>In his recent presidential address before the British Association
  Bateson has inverted this idea. I suspect that his effort was intended as
  little more than a <i>tour de force</i>. He claims for it no more than
  that it is a possible line of speculation. Perhaps he thought the time
  had come to give a shock to our too confident views concerning evolution.
  Be this as it may, he has invented a striking paradox. Evolution has
  taken place through the steady loss of inhibiting factors. Living matter
  was stopped down, so to speak, at the beginning of the world. As the
  stops are lost, new things emerge. Living matter has changed only in that
  it has become simpler.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Natural Selection</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Darwin</i></p>

  <p>Of the four great historical speculations about evolution, the
  doctrine of Natural Selection of Darwin and Wallace has met with the most
  widespread acceptance. In the last <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>lecture I intend to
  examine this theory critically. Here we are concerned only with its
  broadest aspects.</p>

  <p>Darwin appealed to <i>chance variations</i> as supplying evolution
  with the material on which natural selection works. If we accept, for the
  moment, this statement as the cardinal doctrine of natural selection it
  may appear that evolution is due, (1) <i>not</i> to an <i>orderly</i>
  response of the organism to its environment, (2) <i>not</i> in the main
  to the activities of the animal through the use or disuse of its parts,
  (3) <i>not</i> to any innate principle of living material itself, and (4)
  above all <i>not</i> to purpose either from within or from without.
  Darwin made quite clear what he meant by chance. By chance he did not
  mean that the variations were not causal. On the contrary he taught that
  in Science we mean by chance only that the particular combination of
  causes that bring about a variation are not known. They are accidents, it
  is true, but they are causal accidents.</p>

  <p>In his famous book on "Animals and Plants under Domestication", Darwin
  dwells at great length on the nature of the conditions that <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>bring about
  variations. If his views seem to us today at times vague, at times
  problematical, and often without a secure basis, nevertheless we find in
  every instance, that Darwin was searching for the <i>physical causes of
  variation</i>. He brought, in consequence, conviction to many minds that
  there are abundant indications, even if certain proof is lacking, that
  the causes of variation are to be found in natural processes.</p>

  <p>Today the belief that evolution takes place by means of natural
  processes is generally accepted. It does not seem probable that we shall
  ever again have to renew the old contest between evolution and special
  creation.</p>

  <p>But this is not enough. We can never remain satisfied with a negative
  conclusion of this kind. We must find out what natural causes bring about
  variations in animals and plants; and we must also find out what kinds of
  variations are inherited, and how they are inherited. If the
  circumstantial evidence for organic evolution, furnished by comparative
  anatomy, embryology and paleontology is cogent, we should be able to
  observe evolution going on at <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>the present time, i.e. we should be able to
  observe the occurrence of variations and their transmission. This has
  actually been done by the geneticist in the study of mutations and
  Mendelian heredity, as the succeeding lectures will show.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE BEARING OF MENDEL'S DISCOVERY
ON THE ORIGIN OF HEREDITARY
CHARACTERS</p>

  <p>Between the years 1857 and 1868 Gregor Mendel, Augustinian monk,
  studied the heredity of certain characters of the common edible pea, in
  the garden of the monastery at Brünn.</p>

  <p>In his account of his work written in 1868, he said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It requires indeed some courage to undertake a labor of such a
  far-reaching extent; it appears, however, to be the only right way by
  which we can finally reach the solution of a question the importance of
  which cannot be over-estimated in connection with the history of the
  evolution of organic forms."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He tells us also why he selected peas for his work:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The selection of the plant group which shall serve for experiments of
  this kind must be made with all possible care if it be desired to avoid
  from the outset every risk of questionable results."</p>

  <p>"The experimental plants must necessarily <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span></p>

  <p>1. Possess constant differentiating characters.</p>

  <p>2. The hybrids of such plants must, during the flowering period, be
  protected from the influence of all foreign pollen, or be easily capable
  of such protection."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Why do biologists throughout the world to-day agree that Mendel's
  discovery is one of first rank?</p>

  <p>A great deal might be said in this connection. What is essential may
  be said in a few words. Biology had been, and is still, largely a
  descriptive and speculative science. <i>Mendel showed by experimental
  proof that heredity could be explained by a simple mechanism. His
  discovery has been exceedingly fruitful.</i></p>

  <p>Science begins with naïve, often mystic conceptions of its problems.
  It reaches its goal whenever it can replace its early guessing by
  verifiable hypotheses and predictable results. This is what Mendel's law
  did for heredity.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span> Diagram illustrating a
    cross between a red (dark) and a white variety of four o'clock
    (Mirabilis jalapa).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Let us turn to the demonstration of his first law&mdash;the law of
  segregation. The first case I choose is not the one given by Mendel but
  one worked out later by Correns. If the common garden plant called four
  o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa) with red flowers is crossed to one having
  white flowers, the offspring are pink (fig. 13). The hybrid, then, is
  intermediate in the color of its flowers between the two parents. If
  these hybrids are inbred the offspring are white, pink and red, in the
  proportion of 1:2:1. All of these had the same ancestry, yet they are of
  three different kinds. If we did not know their <!-- Page 43 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>history it would be quite
  impossible to state what the ancestry of the white or of the red had
  been, for they might just as well have come from pure white and pure red
  ancestors respectively as to have emerged from the pink hybrids.
  Moreover, when we test them we find that they are as pure as are white or
  red flowering plants that have had all white or all red flowering
  ancestors.</p>

  <p>Mendel's Law explains the results of this cross as shown in figure
  14.</p>

  <p>The egg cell from the white parent carries the factor for white, the
  pollen cell from the red parent carries the factor for red. The hybrid
  formed by their union carries both factors. The result of their combined
  action is to produce flowers intermediate in color.</p>

  <p>When the hybrids mature and their germ cells (eggs or pollen) ripen,
  each carries only one of these factors, either the red or the white, but
  not both. In other words, the two factors that have been brought together
  in the hybrid separate in its germ cells. Half of the egg cells are white
  bearing, half red bearing. Half of the pollen cells are white bearing,
  half red <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>bearing. Chance combinations at
  fertilization give the three classes of individuals of the second
  generation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The white flowering plants should forever breed true, as in fact they
  do. The red flowering plants also breed true. The pink flowering plants,
  having the same composition as the hybrids of the first generation,
  should give the same kind of result. They do, indeed, give this result
  i.e. one white to two pink to one red flowered offspring. <!-- Page 45

    cross between special races of white and black fowls, producing the
    blue (here gray) Andalusian.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another case of the same kind is known to breeders of poultry. One of
  the most beautiful of the domesticated breeds is known as the Andalusian.
  It is a slate blue bird shading into blue-black on the neck and back.
  Breeders know that these blue birds do not breed true but produce white,
  black, and blue offspring. <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

  <p>The explanation of the failure to produce a pure race of Andalusians
  is that they are like the pink flowers of the four o'clock, i.e., they
  are a hybrid type formed by the meeting of the white and the black germ
  cells. If the whites produced by the Andalusians are bred to the blacks
  (both being pure strains), all the offspring will be blue (fig. 15); if
  these blues are inbred they will give 1 white, to 2 blues, to 1 <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>black. In
  other words, the factor for white and the factor for black separate in
  the germ cells of the hybrid Andalusian birds (fig. 16).</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span> Diagram of Mendel's
    cross between yellow (dominant) and green (recessive) peas.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The third case is Mendel's classical case of yellow and green peas
  (fig. 17). He crossed a plant belonging to a race having yellow peas with
  one having green peas. The hybrid plants had yellow seeds. These hybrids
  inbred gave three yellows to one green. The explanation <!-- Page 48
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>(fig. 18) is the
  same in principle as in the preceding cases. The only difference between
  them is that the hybrid which contains both the yellow and the green
  factors is in appearance not intermediate, but like the yellow parent
  stock. Yellow is said therefore to be dominant and green to be
  recessive.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 18.</span> Diagram illustrating
    the history of the factors in the cross shown in Fig. 17.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another example where one of the contrasted characters is dominant is
  shown by the cross of Drosophila with vestigial wings to the wild type
  with long wings (fig. 19). The F<sub>1</sub> flies have long wings not
  differing from those of the wild fly, so far as can be observed. When two
  such flies are inbred there result three long to one vestigial. <!-- Page
  49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span></p>

  <p>The question as to whether a given character is dominant or recessive
  is a matter of no theoretical importance for the principle of
  segregation, although from the notoriety given to it one might easily be
  misled into the erroneous supposition that it was the discovery of this
  relation that is Mendel's crowning achievement.</p>

  <p>Let me illustrate by an example in which the hybrid standing between
  two types overlaps them both. There are two mutant races in our cultures
  of the fruit fly Drosophila that have dark body color, one called sooty,
  another which is even blacker, called ebony (fig. 20). Sooty crossed to
  ebony gives offspring that are intermediate in color. Some of them are so
  much like sooty that they cannot be distinguished from sooty. At the
  other extreme some of the hybrids are as dark as the lightest of the
  ebony flies. If these hybrids are inbred there is a continuous series of
  individuals, sooties, intermediates and ebonies. Which color here shall
  we call the dominant? If the ebony, then in the second generation we
  count three ebonies to one sooty, putting the hybrids with the ebonies.
  If the dominant is the sooty then we count three <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>sooties to one ebony,
  putting the hybrids with the sooties. The important fact to find out is
  whether there actually exist three classes in the second generation. This
  can be ascertained even when, as in this case, there is a perfectly
  graded series from one end to the other, by testing out individually
  enough of the flies to show that one-fourth of them never produce any
  descendants but ebonies, one-fourth never any but sooties, and one-half
  of them give rise to both ebony and sooty.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Mendel's Second Discovery&mdash;Independent Assortment</span></p>

  <p>Besides his discovery that there are pairs of characters that disjoin,
  as it were, in the germ cells of the hybrid (law of segregation) Mendel
  made a second discovery which also has far-reaching consequences. The
  following case illustrates Mendel's second law.</p>

  <p>If a pea that is yellow and round is crossed to one that is green and
  wrinkled (fig. 21), all of the offspring are yellow and round. Inbred,
  these give 9 yellow round, 3 green round, 3 yellow wrinkled, 1 green
  wrinkled. All the yellows taken together are to the green as 3:1. All the
  round taken together are to the wrinkled as three to one; but some of the
  yellows are now wrinkled and some of the green are now <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>round. There has
  been a recombination of characters, while at the same time the results,
  for each pair of characters taken separately, are in accord with Mendel's
  Law of Segregation, (fig. 22). The second law of Mendel may be called the
  law of independent assortment of different character pairs.</p>

  <p>We can, as it were, take the characters of one organism and recombine
  them with those <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  result as due to the assortment of factors for these characters in the

  <p>As a second illustration let me take the <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>classic case of the combs
  of fowls. If a bird with a rose comb is bred to one with a pea comb (fig.
  23), the offspring have a comb different from either. It is called a
  walnut comb. If two such individuals are bred they give 9 walnut, 3 rose,
  3 pea, 1 single. This proportion shows that the grandparental types
  differed in respect to two pairs of characters.</p>

  <p>A fourth case is shown in the fruit fly, where an ebony fly with long
  wings is mated to a grey fly with vestigial wings (fig. 24). The <!--

  <p>The possibility of interchanging characters might be illustrated over
  and over again. It is true not only when two pairs of characters are
  involved, but when three, four, or more enter the cross.</p>

  <p>It is as though we took individuals apart and put together parts of
  two, three or more individuals by substituting one part for another. <!--
  Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span></p>

  <p>Not only has this power to make whatever combinations we choose great
  practical importance, it has even greater theoretical significance; for,
  it follows that the individual is not in itself the unit in heredity, but
  that within the germ-cells there exist smaller units concerned with the
  transmission of characters.</p>

  <p>The older mystical statement of the individual as a unit in heredity
  has no longer any interest in the light of these discoveries, except as a
  past phase of biological history. We see, too, more clearly that the
  sorting out of factors in the germ plasm is a very different process from
  the influence of these factors on the development of the organism. There
  is today no excuse for confusing these two problems.</p>

  <p>If mechanistic principles apply also to embryonic development then the
  course of development is capable of being stated as a series of
  chemico-physical reactions and the "<i>individual</i>" is merely a term
  to express the sum total of such reactions and should not be interpreted
  as something different from or more than these reactions. So long as so
  little is known of the actual processes involved in <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>development the use of
  the term "individuality", while giving the appearance of profundity, in
  reality often serves merely to cover ignorance and to make a mystery out
  of a mechanism.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Characters of Wild Animals and Plants Follow the Same Laws of Inheritance as do the Characters of Domesticated Animals and Plants.</span></p>

  <p>Darwin based many of his conclusions concerning variation and heredity
  on the evidence derived from the garden and from the stock farm. Here he
  was handicapped to some extent, for he had at times to rely on
  information much of which was uncritical, and some of which was
  worthless.</p>

  <p>Today we are at least better informed on <i>two</i> important points;
  one concerning the <i>kinds</i> of variations that furnish to the
  cultivator the materials for his selection; the other concerning the
  modes of inheritance of these variations. We know now that new characters
  are continually appearing in domesticated as well as in wild animals and
  plants, that these characters are often sharply marked <!-- Page 60
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>off from the
  original characters, and whether the differences are great or whether
  they are small they are transmitted alike according to Mendel's law.</p>

  <p>Many of the characteristics of our domesticated animals and cultivated
  plants originated long ago, and only here and there have the records of
  their first appearance been preserved. In only a few instances are these
  records clear and definite, while the complete history of any large group
  of our domesticated products is unknown to us.</p>

  <p>Within the last five or six years, however, from a common wild species
  of fly, the fruit fly, Drosophila ampelophila, which we have brought into
  the laboratory, have arisen over a hundred and twenty-five new types
  whose origin is completely known. Let me call attention to a few of the
  more interesting of these types and their modes of inheritance, comparing
  them with wild types in order to show that the kinds of inheritance found
  in domesticated races occur also in wild types. The results will show
  beyond dispute that the characters of wild types are inherited in
  precisely <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>the same way as are the characters of the
  mutant types&mdash;a fact that is not generally appreciated except by
  students of genetics, although it is of the most far-reaching
  significance for the theory of evolution.</p>

  <p>A mutant appeared in which the eye color of the female was different
  from that of the male. The eye color of the mutant female is a dark eosin
  color, that of the male yellowish eosin. From the beginning this
  difference was as marked as it is to-day. Breeding experiments show that
  eosin eye color differs from the red color of the eye of the wild fly by
  a single mutant factor. Here then at a single step a type appeared that
  was sexually dimorphic.</p>

  <p>Zoölogists know that sexual dimorphism is not uncommon in wild species
  of animals, and Darwin proposed the theory of sexual selection to account
  for the difference between the sexes. He assumed that the male preferred
  certain kinds of females differing from himself in a particular
  character, and thus in time through sexual selection, the sexes came to
  differ from each other. <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

  <p>In the case of eosin eye color no such process as that postulated by
  Darwin to account for the differences between the sexes was involved; for
  the single mutation that brought about the change also brought in the
  dimorphism with it.</p>

  <p>In recent years zoölogists have carefully studied several cases in
  which two types of female are found in the same species. In the common
  clover butterfly, there is a yellow and a white type of female, while the
  male is yellow (fig. 26). It has been shown that a single factor
  difference determines whether the female <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>is yellow or white. The
  inheritance is, according to Gerould, strictly Mendelian.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In Papilio turnus there exist, in the southern states, two kinds of
  females, one yellow like the male, one black (fig. 27). The evidence here
  is not so certain, but it seems probable that a single factor difference
  determines whether the female shall be yellow or black.</p>

  <p>Finally in Papilio polytes of Ceylon and India three different types
  of females appear, <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>(fig. 28 to right) only one of which is like
  the male. Here the analysis of the breeding data shows the possibility of
  explaining this case as due to two pairs Mendelian factors which give in
  combination the three types of female.</p>

  <p>Taking these cases together, they furnish a much simpler explanation
  than the one proposed by Darwin. They show also that characters like
  these shown by wild species may follow Mendel's law. <!-- Page 65

  </div>

  <p>There has appeared in our cultures a fly in which the third division
  of the thorax with its appendages has changed into a segment like the
  second (fig. 29). It is smaller than the normal mesothorax and its wings
  are imperfectly developed, but the bristles on the upper surface may have
  the typical arrangement of the normal mesothorax. The mutant shows how
  great a change may result from a single factor difference.</p>

  <p>A factor that causes duplication in the legs <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>has also been found. Here
  the interesting fact was discovered (Hoge) that duplication takes place
  only in the cold. At ordinary temperatures the legs are normal.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig. 30.</span> Mutant race of fruit
    fly, called eyeless; a, a' normal eye.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In contrast to the last case, where a character is doubled, is the
  next one in which the eyes are lost (fig. 30). This change also took
  place at a single step. All the flies of this stock however, cannot be
  said to be eyeless, since many of them show pieces of the
  eye&mdash;indeed the variation is so wide that the eye may even appear
  like a normal eye unless carefully <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>examined. Formerly we
  were taught that eyeless animals arose in caves. This case shows that
  they may also arise suddenly in glass milk bottles, by a change in a
  single factor.</p>

  <p>I may recall in this connection that wingless flies (fig. 5 f) also
  arose in our cultures by a single mutation. We used to be told that
  wingless insects occurred on desert islands because those insects that
  had the best developed wings had been blown out to sea. Whether this is
  true or not, I will not pretend to say, but at any rate wingless insects
  may also arise, not through a slow process of elimination, but at a
  single step.</p>

  <p>The preceding examples have all related to recessive characters. The
  next one is dominant.</p>

  <p>A single male appeared with a narrow vertical red bar (fig. 31)
  instead of the broad red oval eye. Bred to wild females the new character
  was found to dominate, at least to the extent that the eyes of all its
  offspring were narrower than the normal eye, although not so narrow as
  the eye of the pure stock. Around the bar there is a wide border that
  corresponds to the region occupied by the rest of the eye of the wild
  fly. It lacks however the elements of the eye. It is therefore to be
  looked upon as a rudimentary organ, which is, so to speak, a by-product
  of the dominant mutation.</p>

  <p>The preceding cases have all involved rather great changes in some one
  organ of the body. The following three cases involve slight changes, and
  yet follow the same laws of inheritance as do the larger changes.</p>

  <p>At the base of the wings a minute black speck appeared (fig. 32). It
  was found to be a Mendelian character. In another case the spines on the
  thorax became forked or kinky (fig. 52b). This stock breeds true, and the
  character is inherited in strictly Mendelian fashion.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In a certain stock a number of flies appeared <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>in which the wing pads
  did not expand (fig. 33). It was found that this peculiarity is shown in
  only about twenty per cent of the individuals supposed to inherit it.
  Later it was found that this stock lacked two bristles on the sides of
  the thorax. By means of this knowledge the heredity of the character was
  easily determined. It appears that while the expansion of the wing pads
  fails to occur once in five times&mdash;probably because it is an
  environmental effect peculiar to this stock,&mdash;yet the minute
  difference of the presence or absence of the two lateral bristles is a
  constant feature of the flies that carry this particular factor.</p>

  <p>In the preceding cases I have spoken as though a factor influenced
  only one part of the body. It would have been more accurate to have
  stated that the <i>chief</i> effect of the factor was observed in a
  particular part of the body. Most students of genetics realize that a
  factor difference usually affects more than a single character. For
  example, a mutant stock called rudimentary wings has as its principle
  characteristic very short wings (fig. 34). But the factor for rudimentary
  wings also produces other <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>effects as well. The females are almost
  completely sterile, while the males are fertile. The viability of the
  stock is poor. When flies with rudimentary wings are put into competition
  with wild flies relatively few of the rudimentary flies come through,
  especially if the culture is crowded. The hind legs are also shortened.
  All of these effects are the results of a single factor-difference.</p>

  <p>One may venture the guess that some of the specific and varietal
  differences that are <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>characteristic of wild types and which at
  the same time appear to have no survival value, are only by-products of
  factors whose most important effect is on another part of the organism
  where their influence is of vital importance.</p>

  <p>It is well known that systematists make use of characters that are
  constant for groups of species, but which do not appear in themselves to
  have an adaptive significance. If we may suppose that the constancy of
  such characters may be only an index of the presence of a factor whose
  <i>chief</i> influence is in some other direction or directions, some
  physiological influence, for example, we can give at least a reasonable
  explanation of the constancy of such characters.</p>

  <p>I am inclined to think that an overstatement to the effect that each
  factor may affect the entire body, is less likely to do harm than to
  state that each factor affects only a particular character. The reckless
  use of the phrase "unit character" has done much to mislead the
  uninitiated as to the effects that a single change in the germ plasm may
  produce on the organism. Fortunately, the expression "unit character"
  <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>is
  being less used by those students of genetics who are more careful in
  regard to the implications of their terminology.</p>

  <p>There is a class of cases of inheritance, due to the XY chromosomes,
  that is called sex linked inheritance. It is shown both by mutant
  characters and characters of wild species.</p>

  <p>For instance, white eye color in Drosophila shows sex linked
  inheritance. If a white eyed male is mated to a wild red eyed female
  (fig. 35) all the offspring have red eyes. If these are inbred, there are
  three red to one white eyed offspring, but white eyes occur only in the
  males. The grandfather has transmitted his peculiarity to half of his
  grandsons, but to none of his granddaughters.</p>

  <p>The reciprocal cross (fig. 36) is also interesting. If a white eyed
  female is bred to a red eyed male, all of the daughters have red eyes and
  all of the sons have white eyes. We call this criss-cross inheritance. If
  these offspring are inbred, they produce equal numbers of red eyed and
  white eyed females and equal numbers of red eyed and white eyed males.
  The ratio is 1: 1: 1: 1, or ignoring sex, 2 reds to 2 whites, and not the
  usual 3:1 Mendelian ratio. Yet, as will be shown later, the result is in
  entire accord with Mendel's principle of segregation.</p>

  thorax has large splotches and in the <!-- Page 76 --><span

  <p>In domestic fowls sex linked inheritance has been found as the

  Rock cock (fig. 39), the offspring are all barred. If these are inbred

  <p>It has been found that there may be even more than two factors that
  show Mendelian segregation when brought together in pairs. For example,
  in the southern States there are several races of the grouse locust
  (Paratettix) that differ from each other markedly in color patterns (fig.
  43). When any two individuals of these races are crossed they give, as
  Nabours has shown, in F<sub>2</sub> a Mendelian ratio of 1: 2: 1. It is
  obvious, therefore, that there are here at least nine characters, any two
  of which behave as a Mendelian pair. These races have <!-- Page 83
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>arisen in nature
  and differ definitely and strikingly from each other, yet any two differ
  by only one factor difference.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Similar relations have been found in a number of domesticated races.
  In mice there is a quadruple system represented by the gray house mouse,
  the white bellied, the yellow and the black mouse (fig. 44). In rabbits
  there is probably a triple system, that includes the albino, the
  Himalayan, and the black races. In <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>the silkworm moth there
  have been described four types of larvae, distinguished by different
  color markings, that form a system of quadruple allelomorphs. In
  Drosophila there is a quintuple system of factors in the sex chromosome
  represented by eye colors, a triple system of body colors, and a triple
  system of factors for eye colors in the third chromosome.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Mutation and Evolution</span></p>

  <p>What bearing has the appearance of these new types of Drosophila on
  the theory of evolution may be asked. The objection has been raised in
  fact that in the breeding work with Drosophila we are dealing with
  artificial and unnatural conditions. It has been more than implied that
  results obtained from the breeding pen, the seed pan, the flower pot and
  the milk bottle do not apply to evolution in the "open", nature "at
  large" or to "wild" types. To be consistent, this same objection should
  be extended to the use of the spectroscope in the study of the evolution
  of the stars, to the use of the test tube and the balance by the chemist,
  of the galvanometer by the physicist. All these <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>are unnatural instruments
  used to torture Nature's secrets from her. I venture to think that the
  real antithesis is not between unnatural and natural treatment of Nature,
  but rather between controlled or verifiable data on the one hand, and
  unrestrained generalization on the other.</p>

  <p>If a systematist were asked whether these new races of Drosophila are
  comparable to wild species, he would not hesitate for a moment. He would
  call them all one species. If he were asked why, he would say, I think,
  "These races differ only in one or two striking points, while in a
  hundred other respects they are identical even to the minutest details."
  He would add, that as large a group of wild species of flies would show
  on the whole the reverse relations, <i>viz.</i>, they would differ in
  nearly every detail and be identical in only a few points. In all this I
  entirely agree with the systematist, for I do not think such a group of
  types differing by one character each, is comparable to most wild groups
  of species because the difference between wild species is due to a large
  number of such single differences. The characters <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>that have been
  accumulated in wild species are of significance in the maintenance of the
  species, or at least we are led to infer that even though the visible
  character that we attend to may not itself be important, one at least of
  the other effects of the factors that represent these characters is
  significant. It is, of course, hardly to be expected that <i>any</i>
  random change in as complex a mechanism as an insect would improve the
  mechanism, and as a matter of fact it is doubtful whether any of the
  mutant types so far discovered are better adapted to those conditions to
  which a fly of this structure and habits is already adjusted. But this is
  beside the mark, for modern genetics shows very positively that adaptive
  characters are inherited in exactly the same way as are those that are
  not adaptive; and I have already pointed out that we cannot study a
  single mutant factor without at the same time studying one of the factors
  responsible for normal characters, for the two together constitute the
  Mendelian pair.</p>

  <p>And, finally, I want to urge on your attention a question that we are
  to consider in more detail in the last lecture. Evolution of wild <!--
  Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>species
  appears to have taken place by modifying and improving bit by bit the
  structures and habits that the animal or plant already possessed. We have
  seen that there are thirty mutant factors at least that have an influence
  on eye color, and it is probable that there are at least as many normal
  factors that are involved in the production of the red eye of the wild
  fly.</p>

  <p>Evolution from this point of view has consisted largely in introducing
  new factors that influence characters already present in the animal or
  plant.</p>

  <p>Such a view gives us a somewhat different picture of the process of
  evolution from the old idea of a ferocious struggle between the
  individuals of a species with the survival of the fittest and the
  annihilation of the less fit. Evolution assumes a more peaceful aspect.
  New and advantageous characters survive by incorporating themselves into
  the race, improving it and opening to it new opportunities. In other
  words, the emphasis may be placed less on the competition between the
  individuals of a species (because the destruction of the less fit does
  <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>not
  <i>in itself</i> lead to anything that is new) than on the appearance of
  new characters and modifications of old characters that become
  incorporated in the species, for on these depends the evolution of the
  race.</p>

  <p>The discovery that Mendel made with edible peas concerning heredity

  fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals (including man).</p>

  <p>There must be something that these widely separated groups of plants
  and animals have in common&mdash;some simple mechanism perhaps&mdash;to
  give such definite and orderly series of results. There is, in fact, a
  mechanism, possessed alike by animals and plants, that fulfills every
  requirement of Mendel's principles.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Cellular Basis of Organic Evolution and Heredity</span></p>

  <p>In order to appreciate the full force of the evidence, let me first
  pass rapidly in review a <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>few familiar, historical facts, that
  preceded the discovery of the mechanism in question.</p>

    Dahlgren.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Throughout the greater part of the last century, while students of
  evolution and of heredity were engaged in what I may call the more
  general, or, shall I say, the <i>grosser</i> aspects of the subject,
  there existed another group of students who were engaged in working out
  the minute structure of the material basis of the living organism. They
  found that organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the
  kidneys, etc., are not themselves the units of structure, but that all
  these organs can be reduced to a simpler unit that repeats itself a <!--
  Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>thousand-fold in every organ. We call this
  unit a cell (fig. 45).</p>

  <p>The egg is a cell, and the spermatozoon is a cell. The act of
  fertilization is the union of two cells (fig. 47, upper figure). Simple
  as the process of fertilization appears to us today, its discovery swept
  aside a vast amount of mystical speculation concerning the rôle of the
  male and of the female in the act of procreation.</p>

  <p>Within the cell a new microcosm was revealed. Every cell was found to
  contain a spherical body called the nucleus (fig. 46a). Within the
  nucleus is a network of fibres, a sap fills the interstices of the
  network. The network resolves itself into a definite number of threads at
  each division of the cell (fig. 46 b-e). These threads we call
  chromosomes. Each species of animals and plants possesses a
  characteristic number of these threads which have a definite size and
  sometimes a specific shape and even characteristic granules at different
  levels. Beyond this point our strongest microscopes fail to penetrate.
  Observation has reached, for the time being, its limit.</p>

    rods. (After Dahlgren.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The story is taken up at this point by a new set of students who have
  worked in an entirely different field. Certain observations and
  experiments that we have not time to consider <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>now, led a number of
  biologists to conclude that the chromosomes are the bearers of the
  hereditary units. If so, there should be many such units carried by
  <i>each</i> chromosome, for the number of chromosomes is limited while
  the number of independently inherited characters is large. In Drosophila
  it has been demonstrated not only that there are exactly as many groups
  of characters that are inherited together as there are pairs of
  chromosomes, but even that it is possible to locate one of these groups
  in a particular chromosome and to state the <i>relative position</i>
  there of the factors for the characters. If the validity of this evidence
  is accepted, the study of the cell leads us finally in a mechanical, but
  not in a chemical sense, to the ultimate units about which the whole
  process of the transmission of the hereditary factors centers.</p>

  <p>But before plunging into this somewhat technical matter (that is
  difficult only because it is unfamiliar), certain facts which are
  familiar for the most part should be recalled, because on these turns the
  whole of the subsequent story.</p>

    Selenka.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The thousands of cells that make up the cell-state that we call an
  animal or plant come from the fertilized egg. An hour or two after
  fertilization the egg divides into two cells (fig. 47). Then each half
  divides again. Each <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>quarter next divides. The process continues
  until a large number of cells is formed and out of these organs mould
  themselves.</p>

    the beetle, Calligrapha, showing the pigment at one end where the germ
    cells will later develop as shown in the other two figures. (After
    Hegner.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>At every division of the cell the chromosomes also divide. Half of
  these have come from the mother, half from the father. Every cell
  contains, therefore, the sum total of all the chromosomes, and if these
  are the bearers of the hereditary qualities, every cell in the body, <!--
  Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>whatever
  its function, has a common inheritance.</p>

  <p>At an early stage in the development of the animal certain cells are
  set apart to form the organs of reproduction. In some animals these cells
  can be identified early in the cleavage (fig. 48).</p>

  <p>The reproductive cells are at first like all the other cells in the
  body in that they contain a full complement of chromosomes, half paternal
  and half maternal in origin (fig. 49). They divide as do the other cells
  of the body for a long time (fig. 49, upper row). At each division each
  chromosome splits lengthwise and its halves migrate to opposite poles of
  the spindle (fig. 49 c).</p>

  <p>But there comes a time when a new process appears in the germ cells
  (fig 49 e-h). It is essentially the same in the egg and in the sperm
  cells. The discovery of this process we owe to the laborious researches
  of many workers in many countries. The list of their names is long, and I
  shall not even attempt to repeat it. The chromosomes come together in
  pairs (fig. 49 a). Each maternal chromosome mates with a paternal
  chromosome of the same kind. <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span></p>

  </div>

  <p>Then follow two rapid divisions (fig. 49 f, g and 50 and 51). At one
  of the divisions the double chromosomes separate so that each resulting
  cell comes to contain some maternal and <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>some paternal
  chromosomes, i.e. one or the other member of each pair. At the other
  division each chromosome simply splits as in ordinary cell division.</p>

  spermatozoa (fig. <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity Discovered in the Behavior of the Chromosomes</span></p>

  <p>If the factors in heredity are carried in the chromosomes and if the
  chromosomes are definite structures, we should anticipate that there
  should be as many <i>groups</i> of characters as there are kinds of
  chromosomes. In only one <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>case has a sufficient number of characters
  been studied to show whether there is any correspondence between the
  number of hereditary groups of characters and the number of chromosomes.
  In the fruit fly, Drosophila ampelophila, we have found about 125
  characters that are inherited in a perfectly definite way. On the
  opposite page is a list of some of them.</p>

  <p>It will be observed in this list that the characters are arranged in
  four groups, Groups I, II, III and IV. Three of these groups are equally
  large or nearly so; Group IV contains only two characters. The characters
  are put into these groups because in heredity the members of each group
  tend to be inherited together, i.e., if two or more enter the cross
  together they tend to remain together through subsequent generations. On
  the other hand, any member of one group is inherited entirely
  independently of any member of the other groups; in the same way as
  Mendel's yellow-green pair of characters is inherited independently of
  the round-wrinkled pair.</p>

  <p>If the factors for these characters are carried by the chromosomes,
  then we should expect that those factors that are carried by the same
  chromosome would be inherited together, provided the chromosomes are
  definite structures in the cell.</p>

  <p>In the chromosome group of Drosophila, (fig. 52) there are <i>four</i>
  pairs of chromosomes, three of nearly the same size and one much smaller.
  Not only is there agreement between the number of hereditary groups and
  the number of the chromosomes, but even the size relations are the same,
  for there are three great groups of characters and three pairs of large
  chromosomes, and one small group of characters and one pair of small
  chromosomes. <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Four Great Linkage Groups of Drosophila Ampelophila</span></p>

  <p>The following description of the characters of the wild fly may be
  useful in connection with the account of the modifications of these
  characters that appear in the mutants.</p>

  <p>The head and thorax of the wild fly are grayish-yellow, the abdomen is
  banded with alternate stripes of yellow and black. In the male, (fig. 4
  to right), there are three narrow bands and a black tip. In the female
  there are five black bands (fig. 4 to left). The wings are gray with a
  surface texture of such a kind that at certain angles they are
  iridescent. The eyes are a deep, solid, brick-red. The minute hairs that
  cover the body have a very definite arrangement that is most obvious on
  the head and thorax. There is a definite number of larger hairs called
  bristles or chaetae which have a characteristic position and are used for
  diagnostic purposes in classifying the species. On the foreleg of the
  male there is a comb-like organ formed by a row of bristles; it is absent
  in the female. The comb is a secondary sexual character, and it is, so
  far as known, functionless. <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span></p>

  <p>Some of the characters of the mutant types are shown in figures <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `52, 53, 54, 55'.">53, 54, 55,
  56</span>. The drawing of a single fly is often used here to illustrate
  more than one character. This is done to economize space, but of course
  there would be no difficulty in actually bringing together in the same
  individual any two or more characters belonging to the same group (or to
  different groups). Without colored figures it is not possible to show
  many of the most striking differences of these mutant races; at most dark
  and light coloring can be indicated by the shading of the body, wings, or
  eyes.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Group I</i></p>

  <p>In the six flies drawn in figure 53 there are shown five different
  wing characters. The first of these types (a) is called cut, because the
  ends of the wings look as though they had been cut to a point. The
  antennae are displaced downward and appressed and their bristle-like
  aristae are crumpled.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">

      alt="Fig. 53." title="Fig. 53." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 53.</span> Group I. (See text)
  </div>

  <p>The second figure (b) represents a fly with a notch in the ends of the
  wings. This character is dominant, but the same factor that <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>produces the
  notch in the wings is also a recessive lethal factor; because of this
  latter effect of the character no males of this race exist, and the
  females of the race are never pure but hybrid. Every female with notch
  wings bred to a wild male, will produce in equal numbers notch winged
  daughters and daughters with normal wings. There will be half as many
  sons as daughters. The explanation of <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>this peculiar result is
  quite simple. Every notch winged female has one X chromosome that carries
  the factor for notch and one X chromosome that is "normal". Daughters
  receiving the former chromosomes are notched because the factor for notch
  is dominant, but they are not killed since the lethal effect of the notch
  factor is recessive to the normal allelomorph carried by the other
  chromosome that the daughters get from their father. This normal factor
  is recessive for notch but dominant for life. This same figure (b) is
  used here to show three other sex linked characters. The spines on the
  thorax are twisted or kinky, which is due to a factor called "forked".
  The effect is best seen on the thorax, but all spines on the body are
  similarly modified; even the minute hairs are also affected. Ruby eye
  color might be here represented&mdash;if the eyes in the figure were
  colored. The lighter color of the body and antennae is intended to
  indicate that the character tan is also present. The light color of the
  antennae is the most certain way of identifying tan. The tan flies are
  interesting because they have lost the positive heliotropism <!-- Page
  107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>that is so
  marked a feature in the behavior of D. ampelophila. As this peculiarity
  of the tan flies is inherited like all the other sex linked characters,
  it follows that when a tan female is bred to a wild male all the sons
  inherit the recessive tan color and indifference to light, while the
  daughters show the dominant sex linked character of their father, i.e.,
  they are "gray", and go to the light. Hence when such a brood is
  disturbed the females fly to the light, but the males remain behind.</p>

  <p>One of the first mutants that appeared in D. ampelophila was called
  rudimentary on account of the condition of the wings (c). The same
  mutation has appeared independently several times. In the drawing (c) the
  dark body color is intended to indicate "sable" and the lighter color of
  the eyes is intended to indicate eosin. This eye color, which is an
  allelomorph of white, is also interesting because in the female the color
  is deeper than in the male. In other cases of sex linked factors the
  character is the same in the two sexes.</p>

  <p>In the fourth figure (d) the third and fourth longitudinal veins of
  the wing are <i>fused</i> into <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>one vein from the base of the wing to the
  level of the first cross-vein and in addition converge and meet near
  their outer ends. The shape of the eye is represented in the figure as
  different from the normal, due to another factor called "bar". This is a
  dominant character, the hybrid condition being also narrow, but not so
  narrow as the pure type. Vermilion eye color might also be here
  represented&mdash;due to a factor that has appeared independently on
  several occasions.</p>

  <p>In the fifth figure (e) the wings are shorter and more pointed than in
  the wild fly. This character is called miniature. The light color of the
  drawing may be taken to represent yellow body color, and the light color
  of the eye white eye color.</p>

  <p>In the last figure (f) the wings are represented as pads, essentially
  in the same condition that they are in when the fly emerges from the pupa
  case. Not all the flies of this stock have the wings in this condition;
  some have fully expanded wings that appear normal in all respects.
  Nevertheless, about the same percentage of offspring show the pads
  irrespective of <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>whether the parents had pads or expanded
  wings.</p>

  <p>The flies of this stock show, however, another character, which is a
  product of the same factor, and which is constant, i.e., repeated in all
  individuals. The two bristles on the sides of the thorax are constantly
  absent in this race. The lighter color of the eye in the figure may be
  taken to indicate buff&mdash;a faint yellowish color. The factor for this
  eye color is another allelomorph of white.</p>

  <p>There are many other interesting characters that belong to the first
  group, such as abnormal abdomen, short legs, duplication of the legs,
  etc. In fact, any part of the body may be affected by a sex-linked
  factor.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Group II</i></p>

  <p>In the first figure (a) of figure 54 that contains members of Group II
  the wings are almost entirely absent or "vestigial". This condition arose
  at a single step and breeds true, although it appears to be influenced to
  some extent by temperature, also by modifiers that sometimes appear in
  the stock. Purple <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>eye color belongs in Group II; it
  resembles the color of the eye of the wild fly but is darker and more
  translucent.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 54.</span> Group II. (See text.)
  </div>

  <p>In the second figure (b) the wing is again long and narrow and
  sometimes bent back on itself, as shown here. In several respects the
  wing resembles strap (d) but seems to be due <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>to another factor,
  called antler, insufficiently studied as yet.</p>

  <p>In the third figure (c) the wings turn up at the end. This is brought
  about by the presence of the factor called jaunty.</p>

  <p>In the fourth figure the wings are long and narrow and several of the
  veins are unrepresented. This character, "strap", is very variable and
  has not yet been thoroughly studied. On the thorax there is a deep black
  mark called trefoil. Even in the wild fly there is a three pronged mark
  on the thorax present in many individuals. Trefoil is a further
  development and modification of this mark and is due to a special
  factor.</p>

  <p>In the fifth figure (e) the wings are arched. The factor is called
  arc. The dark color of the body, and especially of the wings, indicates
  the factor for black.</p>

  <p>The sixth figure (f) shows the wings "curved" downwards. In addition
  there is present a minute black speck at the base of each wing, due to
  another factor called speck.</p>

  <p>In the seventh figure (g) the wing is truncate. Its end is obliquely
  squared instead of <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>rounded; it may be longer than the body,
  or shorter when other modifying factors are present. The mutation that
  produces this type of wing is of not infrequent occurrence. It has been
  shown by Muller and Altenburg that there are at least two factors that
  modify this character&mdash;the chief factor is present in the second
  chromosome; alone it produces the truncate wing in only a certain
  percentage of cases, but when the modifiers are also present about ninety
  percent of the individuals may show the truncate condition of the wing.
  But the presence of these factors makes the stock very infertile, so that
  it is difficult to maintain.</p>

  <p>In the eighth figure (h) the legs are shortened owing to the absence
  of a segment of the tarsus. The stock is called dachs&mdash;a nickname
  given to it because the short legs suggested the dachshund.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Group III</i></p>

  <p>In figure 55, (a), a mutant type called bithorax is shown. The old
  metathorax is replaced by another mesothorax thrust in between the normal
  mesothorax and the abdomen. It <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>carries a pair of wings that do not
  completely unfold. On this new mesothorax the characteristic arrangement
  of the bristles is shown. Thus at a single step a typical region of the
  body has doubled. The character is recessive.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 55.</span> Group III. (See text.)
  </div>

  <p>The size of the adult fly of D. ampelophila varies greatly according
  to the amount of nourishment obtained by the larva. After the fly emerges
  its size remains nearly constant, as in many insects. Two races have,
  <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>however, been separated by Bridges that
  are different in size as a result of a genetic factor. The first of
  these, called dwarf, is represented by figure 55, (b).</p>

  <p>The race is minute, although of course its size is variable, depending
  on food and other conditions. The same figure shows the presence of
  another factor, "sooty", that makes the fly very dark. Maroon eye color
  might be here represented, due to still another factor.</p>

  <p>In the third figure (c) the other mutation in size is shown. It is
  called "giant". The flies are twice the size of wild flies. An eye color,
  called peach, might here be represented. It is an allelomorph of
  pink.</p>

  <p>In the fourth figure (d) the mutant called dichaete is shown. It is
  characterized by the absence of two of the bristles on the thorax. Other
  bristles may also be absent, but not so constantly as the two just
  mentioned. Another effect of the same factor is the spread-out condition
  of the wings. The very dark eye color in this figure may be taken to
  indicate the presence of another factor, "sepia", which causes the eyes
  to assume a brown color that <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>becomes black with age. Most of the other
  mutations in eye color that have occurred tend to give a lighter color:
  this one, which is also recessive, makes the eye darker.</p>

  <p>In the fifth figure (e) the color of the darkest fly is due to a
  factor called ebony, which is an allelomorph of sooty.</p>

  <p>In the sixth figure (f) the wings are beaded, i.e., the margin is
  defective at intervals, giving a beaded-like outline to the wings. This
  condition is very variable and much affected by other factors that
  influence the shape of the wings. The lighter eye color of the drawing
  may be taken to represent pink.</p>

  <p>In the seventh figure (g) the wings are curled up over the back. This
  is a recessive character.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Group IV</i></p>

  <p>Only two mutants have been obtained that do not belong to any of the
  preceding groups; these are put together in Group IV. It has been shown
  that they are linked to each other and the linkage is so close that it
  has thus far been impossible to obtain the dominant recessive. <!-- Page
  116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>One of
  these mutants, called "eyeless" (fig. 56, a, a<sup>1</sup>), is
  variable&mdash;the eyes are often entirely absent or represented by one
  or more groups of ommatidia. The outline of the original eye, so to
  speak, is strongly marked out and its area might be called a rudimentary
  organ, if such a statement has any meaning here.</p>

  <p>The other figure (b) represents "bent", so called from the shape of
  the wings. This <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>mutant is likewise very variable, often
  indistinguishable from the wild type, yet when well developed strikingly
  different from any other mutant.</p>

  <p>This brief account of a few of the mutant races that can be most
  easily represented by uncolored figures will serve to show how all parts
  of the body may change, some of the changes being so slight that they
  would be overlooked except by an expert, others so great that in the
  character affected the flies depart far from the original species.</p>

  <p><i>It is important to note that mutations in the first chromosome are
  not limited to any part of the body nor do they affect more frequently a
  particular part. The same statement holds equally for all of the other
  chromosomes. In fact, since each factor may affect visibly several parts
  of the body at the same time there are no grounds for expecting any
  special relation between a given chromosome and special regions of the
  body. It can not too insistently be urged that when we say a character is
  the product of a particular factor we mean no more than that it is the
  most conspicuous effect of the factor.</i> <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span></p>

  <p>If, then, as these and other results to be described point to the
  chromosomes as the bearers of the Mendelian factors, and if, as will be
  shown presently, these factors have a definite location in the
  chromosomes it is clear that the location of the factors in the
  chromosomes bears no spatial relation to the location of the parts of the
  body to each other.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Localization of Factors in the Chromosomes</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Sex Linked Inheritance</i></p>

  <p>When we follow the history of pairs of chromosomes we find that their
  distribution in successive generations is paralleled by the inheritance
  of Mendelian characters. This is best shown in the sex chromosomes (fig.
  57). In the female there are two of these chromosomes that we call the X
  chromosomes; in the male there are also two but one differs from those of
  the female in its shape, and in the fact that it carries none of the
  normal allelomorphs of the mutant factors. It is called the Y
  chromosome.</p>

  <p>The course followed by the sex chromosomes and that by the characters
  in the case of sex <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>linked inheritance are shown in the next
  diagram of Drosophila illustrating a cross between a white eyed male and
  a red eyed female.</p>

  <p>The first of these represents a cross between a white eyed male and a
  red eyed female (fig. 58, top row). The X chromosome in the male is
  represented by an open bar, the Y chromosome is bent. In the female the
  two X chromosomes are black. Each egg of such a female will contain one
  "black" X after the polar bodies have been thrown off. In the male there
  will be two classes of sperm&mdash;the female-producing, carrying the
  (open) X, and the male-producing, carrying the Y chromosome. Any egg
  fertilized by an X bearing sperm will produce a female that will have red
  eyes because the X (black) chromosome it gets from the mother carries the
  dominant factor for red. Any egg fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm will
  produce a male that will also have red eyes because he gets his (black) X
  chromosome from his mother.</p>

<p><!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>When, then, these two F<sub>1</sub> flies (second row) are inbred the
  following combinations are expected. Each egg will contain a black X (red
  eye producing) or a white X (white eye producing) after the polar bodies
  have been extruded. The male will produce two kinds of sperms, of which
  the female producing will contain a black X (red eye producing). Since
  any egg may by chance be fertilized by any sperm there will result the
  four classes of individuals shown on the bottom row of the diagram. All
  the females will have red eyes, because irrespective of the two kinds of
  eggs involved all the female-producing sperm carry a black X. Half of the
  males have red eyes because half of the eggs have had each a
  red-producing X chromosome. The other half of the males have white eyes,
  because the other half of the eggs had each a white-producing X
  chromosome. Other evidence has shown that the Y chromosome of the male is
  indifferent, so far as these Mendelian factors are concerned.</p>

  <p>The reciprocal experiment is illustrated in figure 59. A white eyed
  female is mated to a red eyed male (top row). All the mature eggs of such
  a female contain one white-producing X chromosome represented by the open
  bar in the diagram. The red eyed male contains female-producing X-bearing
  sperm that carry the factor for red eye color, and male-producing Y
  chromosomes. Any egg fertilized by an X-bearing sperm will become a red
  eyed female because the X chromosome that comes from the father carries
  the dominant factor for red eye color. Any egg fertilized by a Y-bearing
  sperm will become a male with white eyes because the only X chromosome
  that the male contains comes from his mother and is white producing. <!--
  Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span></p>

  <p>When these two F<sub>1</sub> flies are inbred (middle row) the
  following combinations are expected. Half the eggs will contain each a
  white producing X chromosome and half red producing. The female-producing
  sperms will each contain a white X and the male-producing sperms will
  each contain an indifferent Y chromosome. Chance meetings of egg and
  sperm will give the four F<sub>2</sub> classes (bottom row). These
  consist of white eyed and red eyed females and white eyed and red eyed
  males. The ratio here is 1:1 and not three to one (3:1) as in other
  Mendelian cases. But Mendel's law of segregation is not transgressed, as
  the preceding analysis has shown; for, the chromosomes have followed
  strictly the course laid down on Mendel's principle for the distribution
  of factors. The peculiar result in this case is due to the fact that the
  F<sub>1</sub> male gets his single factor for eye color from his mother
  only and it is linked to or contained in a body (the X chromosome) that
  is involved in producing the females, while the mate of this
  body&mdash;the Y chromosome&mdash;is indifferent with regard to these
  factors, yet active as a mate to X in synapsis. <!-- Page 125 --><span

  <p>In man there are several characters that show exactly this same kind
  of inheritance. Color blindness, or at least certain kinds of color
  blindness, appear to follow the same scheme. A color blind father
  transmits through his daughters his peculiarity to half of his grandsons,
  but to none of his grand-daughters (fig. 38A). The result is the same as
  in the case of the white eyed male of Drosophila. Color blind women are
  rather unusual, which is expected from the method of inheritance of this
  character, but in the few known cases where such color blind women have
  married normal husbands the sons have inherited the peculiarity from the
  mother (fig. 38B). Here again the result is the same as for the similar
  combination in Drosophila. <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

  <p>In man the sex formula appears to be XX for the female and XO for the
  male (fig. 60), and since the relation is essentially the same as that in
  Drosophila the chromosome explanation is the same. According to von
  Winiwarter there are 48 chromosomes in the female and 47 in the male
  (fig. 61). After the extrusion of the polar bodies there are 24
  chromosomes in the egg. In the male at one of the two maturation <!--
  Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span>divisions the X chromosome passes to one
  pole undivided (fig. 61, C). In consequence there are two classes of
  sperms in man; female producing containing 24 chromosomes, and male
  producing containing 23 chromosomes. If the factor for color blindness is
  carried by the X chromosome its inheritance in man works out on the same
  chromosome scheme and in the same way as does white eye color (or any
  other sex linked character) in the fly, for the O sperm in man is
  equivalent to the Y sperm in the fly.</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>In these cases we have been dealing with a single pair of characters.
  Let us now take a case where two pairs of sex linked characters enter the
  cross at the same time, and preferably a case where the two recessives
  enter the cross from the same parent.</p>

  <p>If a female with white eyes and yellow wings is crossed to a wild male
  with red eyes and gray wings (fig. 62), the sons are yellow and have
  white eyes and the daughters are gray and have red eyes. If two
  F<sub>1</sub> flies are mated they will produce the following classes.

  <p>Not only have the two grandparental combinations reappeared, but in
  addition two new combinations, viz., grey white and yellow red. The two
  original combinations far exceed in numbers the new or exchange
  combinations. If we follow the history of the X chromosomes we discover
  that the <i>larger classes</i> of grandchildren appear in accord with the
  way in which the X chromosomes are transmitted from one generation to the
  next.</p>

  <p>The <i>smaller classes</i> of grandchildren, the exchange combinations
  or cross-overs, as we call them, can be explained by the assumption that
  at some stage in their history an interchange of parts has taken place
  between the chromosomes. This is indicated in the diagrams.</p>

  <p>The most important fact brought out by the experiment is that the
  factors that went in together tend to stick together. It makes no
  difference in what combination the members of <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span>the two pairs of
  characters enter, they tend to remain in that combination.</p>

  <p>If one admits that the sex chromosomes carry these factors for the
  sex-linked characters&mdash;and the evidence is certainly very strong in
  favor of this view&mdash;it follows necessarily from these facts that at
  some time in their history there has been an interchange between the two
  sex chromosomes in the female.</p>

  <p>There are several stages in the conjugation of the chromosomes at
  which such an interchange between the members of a pair might occur.
  There is further a small amount of direct evidence, unfortunately very
  meagre at present, showing that an interchange does actually occur.</p>

  <p>At the ripening period of the germ cell the members of each pair of
  chromosomes come together (fig. 49, e). In several forms they have been
  described as meeting at one end and then progressively coming to lie side
  by side as shown in fig. 63, e, f, g, h, i. At the end of the process
  they appear to have completely united along their length (fig. 63, j, k,
  l). It is always a maternal and a paternal <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>chromosome that meet in
  this way and always two of the same kind. It has been observed that as
  the members of a pair come together they occasionally twist around each
  other (fig. 63, g, l, and 64, and 65). In consequence a part of one
  chromosome comes to be now on one side and now on the other side of its
  mate.</p>

  <p>When the chromosomes separate at the next division of the germ cell
  the part on one side passes to one pole, the part on the other to the
  opposite pole, (figs. 64 and 65). Whenever the chromosomes do not untwist
  at this time there must result an interchange of pieces where they were
  crossed over each other.</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>The combinations that entered are more common in the F<sub>2</sub>
  generations than the cross-over classes, showing that there is linkage of
  the factors that entered together.</p>

  <p>Another curious fact is brought out if instead of back-crossing the
  F<sub>1</sub> female we back-cross the F<sub>1</sub> male to a black
  vestigial female. Their offspring are now of only two kinds, black
  vestigial and gray long. This means that in the male there is no
  crossing-over or interchange of pieces. This relation holds not only for
  the Group II but for all the other groups as well.</p>

  <p>Why interchange takes place in the female of Drosophila and not in the
  male we do not know at present. We might surmise that when in the male
  the members of a pair come together they do not twist around each other,
  hence no crossing-over results.</p>

  <p>If we assume that the nearer together the factors lie in the

  conversely the farther apart they lie the more likely is a twist to occur
  between them, we can understand how the linkage is different for
  different pairs of factors.</p>

  <p>On this basis we have made out chromosomal maps for each chromosome
  (fig. 67). The diagram indicates those loci that have been most
  accurately placed.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Interference</i></p>

  <p>There is a considerable body of information that we have obtained that
  corroborates the location of the factors in the chromosome. This evidence
  is too technical to take up in any detail, but there is one result that
  is so important that I must attempt to explain it. If, as I assume,
  crossing over is brought about by twisting of the chromosomes, and if
  owing to the material of the chromosomes there is a most frequent
  distance of internode, then, when crossing over between nodes takes place
  at same level at a-b in figure 68, the region on <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>each side of that
  point, a to A and b to B, should be protected, so to speak, from further
  crossing over. This in fact we have found to be the case. No other
  explanation so far proposed will account for this extraordinary
  relation.</p>

  <p>What advantage, may be asked, is there in obtaining numerical data of
  this kind? It is this:&mdash;whenever a new character appears we need
  only determine in which of the four groups it lies and its distance from
  two members within that group. With this information we can predict with
  a high degree of probability what results it will give with any other
  member of any group. Thus we can do on paper what would require many
  months of labor by making the actual experiment. In a word we can predict
  what will happen in a situation where prediction is impossible without
  this numerical information. <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Evidence from Non-Disjunction</i></p>

  <p>In the course of the work on Drosophila exceptions appeared in one
  strain where certain individuals did not conform to the scheme of sex
  linked inheritance. For a moment the hypothesis seemed to fail, but a
  careful examination led to the suspicion that in this strain something
  had happened to the sex chromosomes. It was seen that if in some way the
  X chromosomes failed to disjoin in certain eggs, the exceptions could be
  explained. The analysis led to the suggestion that if the Y chromosome
  had got into the female line the results would be accounted for, since
  its presence there would be expected to cause this peculiar
  non-disjunction of the X chromosomes.</p>

  <p>That this was the explanation was shown when the material was
  examined. The females that gave these results were found by Bridges to
  have two X's and a Y chromosome.</p>

  <p>The normal chromosome group of the female is shown in figure 52 and
  the chromosome group of one of the exceptional females is shown in figure
  69. In a female of this kind <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  as their composition requires. Other tests may also be made of the other
  classes of offspring. Bridges has shown that they fulfill all the

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">How Many Genetic Factors are there in the Germ-plasm of a Single Individual</span></p>

  <p>In passing I invite your attention to a speculation based on our maps
  of the chromosomes&mdash;a speculation which I must insist does not
  pretend to be more than a guess but has at least the interest of being
  the first guess that we have ever been in position to make as to how many
  factors go towards the makeup of the germ plasm. <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

  <p>We have found practically no factors less than .04 of a unit apart. If
  our map includes the entire length of the chromosomes and if we assume
  factors are uniformly distributed along the chromosome at distances equal
  to the shortest distance yet observed, viz. .04, then we can calculate
  roughly how many hereditary factors there are in Drosophila. The
  calculation gives about 7500 factors. The reader should be cautioned
  against accepting the above assumptions as strictly true, for
  crossing-over values are known to differ according to different
  environmental conditions (as shown by Bridges for age), and to differ
  even in different parts of the chromosome as a result of the presence of
  specific genetic factors (as shown by Sturtevant). Since all the
  chromosomes except the X chromosomes are double we must double our
  estimate to give the <i>total</i> number of factors, but the half number
  is the number of the different kinds of factors of Drosophila. <!-- Page

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Conclusions</span></p>

  <p>I have passed in review a long series of researches as to the nature
  of the hereditary material. We have in consequence of this work arrived
  within sight of a result that seemed a few years ago far beyond our
  reach. The mechanism of heredity has, I think, been
  discovered&mdash;discovered not by a flash of intuition but as the result
  of patient and careful study of the evidence itself.</p>

  <p>With the discovery of this mechanism I venture the opinion that the
  problem of heredity has been solved. We know how the factors carried by
  the parents are sorted out to the germ cells. The explanation does not
  pretend to state how factors arise or how they influence the development
  of the embryo. But these have never been an integral part of the doctrine
  of heredity. The problems which they present must be worked out in their
  own field. So, I repeat, the mechanism of the chromosomes offers a
  satisfactory solution of the traditional problem of heredity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SELECTION AND EVOLUTION</p>

  <p>Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection still holds today first place in
  every discussion of evolution, and for this very reason the theory calls
  for careful scrutiny; for it is not difficult to show that the expression
  "natural selection" is to many men a metaphor that carries many meanings,
  and sometimes different meanings to different men. While I heartily agree
  with my fellow biologists in ascribing to Darwin himself, and to his
  work, the first place in biological philosophy, yet recognition of this
  claim should not deter us from a careful analysis of the situation in the
  light of work that has been done since Darwin's time.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Theory of Natural Selection</span></p>

  <p>In his great book on the <i>Origin of Species</i>, Darwin tried to do
  two things: first, to show that the evidence bearing on evolution makes
  <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>that explanation probable. No such great
  body of evidence had ever been brought together before, and it wrought,
  as we all know, a revolution in our modes of thinking.</p>

  <p>Darwin also set himself the task of showing <i>how</i> evolution might
  have taken place. He pointed to the influence of the environment, to the
  effects of use and disuse, and to natural selection. It is to the last
  theory that his name is especially attached. He appealed to a fact
  familiar to everyone, that no two individuals are identical and that some
  of the differences that they show are inherited. He argued that those
  individuals that are best suited to their environment are the most
  probable ones to survive and to leave most offspring. In consequence
  their descendants should in time replace through competition the less
  well-adapted individuals of the species. This is the process Darwin
  called natural selection, and Spencer the survival of the fittest.</p>

  <p>Stated in these general terms there is nothing in the theory to which
  anyone is likely to take exception. But let us examine the argument more
  critically. <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span></p>

    tree arranged according to size. (After de Vries.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>If we measure, or weigh, or classify any character shown by the
  individuals of a population, we find differences. We recognize that some
  of the differences are due to the varied experiences that the individuals
  have encountered in the course of their lives, i.e. to their environment,
  but we also recognize that some of the differences may be due to
  individuals having different inheritances&mdash;different germ plasms.
  Some familiar examples will help to bring home this relation.</p>

  <p>If the leaves of a tree are arranged according to size (fig. 71), we
  find a continuous series, but there are more leaves of medium size than
  extremes. If a lot of beans be sorted out <!-- Page 148 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>according to their
  weights, and those between certain weights put into cylinders, the
  cylinders, when arranged according to the size of the beans, will appear
  as shown in figure 72. An imaginary line running over the tops of the
  piles will give a curve (fig. 73) that corresponds to the curve of
  probability (fig. 74).</p>

  <p>The differences in size shown by the individual beans or by the
  individual men are due in part to heredity, in part to the environment
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>in which they have developed. This is a
  familiar fact of almost every-day observation. It is well shown in the
  following example. In figure 76 the two boys and the two varieties of
  corn, which they are holding, differ in height. The pedigrees of the boys
  (fig. 77) make it probable that their height is largely inherited and the
  two races of corn are known to belong to a tall and a short race
  respectively. Here, then, the chief effect or difference is due to
  heredity. On the other hand, if individuals of the same race develop in a
  favorable environment the result is different from the development in an
  unfavorable environment, as shown in figure 78. Here to the right the
  corn is crowded and in consequence dwarfed, while to the left the same
  kind of corn has had more room to develop and is taller.</p>

  <p>Darwin knew that if selection of particular kinds of individuals of a
  population takes place the next generation is affected. If the taller men
  of a community are selected <i>the average</i> of their offspring will be
  taller than the average of the former population. If selection for
  tallness again takes place, still taller men will <i>on the average</i>
  arise. If, amongst these, selection again makes a choice the process
  would, he thought, continue (fig. 79).</p>

<p><!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span></p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 78. A race of corn reared
    under different conditions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>We now recognize that this statement contains an important truth, but
  we have found that it contains only a part of the truth. Any one who
  repeats for himself this kind of selection experiment will find that
  while his average class will often change in the direction of his
  selection, the process slows down as a rule rather suddenly (fig. 80). He
  finds, moreover, that the limits of variability are not necessarily
  transcended as the process continues even although the average may for a
  while be increased. More tall men may be produced by selection of this
  kind, but the tallest men are not necessarily any taller than the tallest
  in the original population. <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

  <p>Selection, then, has not produced anything new, but only more of
  certain kinds of individuals. Evolution, however, means producing more
  new things, not more of what already exists.</p>

  <p>Darwin seems to have thought that the range of variation shown by the
  offspring of a given individual about that type of individual would be as
  wide as the range shown by the original population (fig. 79), but
  Galton's work has made it clear that this is not the case in a general or
  mixed population. If the offspring of individuals continued to show, as
  Darwin seems to have thought, as wide a range on each side of their
  parents' size, so to speak, as did the original population, then it would
  follow that <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span>selection could slide successive
  generations along in the direction of selection.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Darwin himself was extraordinarily careful, however, in the statements
  he made in this connection and it is rather by implication than by actual
  reference that one can ascribe this <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>meaning to his views.
  His contemporaries and many of his followers, however, appear to have
  accepted this <i>sliding scale</i> interpretation as the cardinal
  doctrine of evolution. If this is doubted or my statement is challenged
  then one must explain why de Vries' mutation theory met with so little
  enthusiasm amongst the older group of zoölogists and botanists; and one
  must explain why Johannsen's splendid work met with such bitter
  opposition from the English school&mdash;the biometricians&mdash;who
  amongst the post-Darwinian school are assumed to be the lineal
  descendants of Darwin.</p>

  <p>And in this connection we should not forget that just this sort of
  process was supposed to take place in the inheritance of use and disuse.
  What is gained in one generation forms the basis for further gains in the
  next generation. Now, Darwin not only believed that acquired characters
  are inherited but turned more and more to this explanation in his later
  writings. Let us, however, not make too much of the matter; for it is
  much less important to find out whether Darwin's ideas were vague, than
  it is to make sure that our own ideas are clear. <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span></p>

  <p>If I have made several statements here that appear dogmatic let me now
  attempt to justify them, or at least give the evidence which seems to me
  to make them probable.</p>

  <p>The work of the Danish botanist, Johannsen, has given us the most
  carefully analyzed case of selection that has ever been obtained. There
  are, moreover, special reasons why the material that he used is better
  suited to give definite information than any other so far studied.
  Johannsen worked with the common bean, weighing the seeds or else
  measuring them. These beans if taken from many plants at random give the
  typical curve of probability (fig. 74). The plant multiplies by
  self-fertilization. Taking advantage of this fact Johannsen kept the
  seeds of each plant separate from the others, and raised from them a new
  generation. When curves were made from these new groups it was found that
  some of them had different modes from that of the original general
  population (fig. 81 A-E, bottom group). They are shown in the upper
  groups (A, B, C, D, E). But do not understand me to say that the
  offspring of each bean gave a different mode. <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/fig_081.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_081.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 81." title="Fig. 81." /></a>
    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 81. Pure lines of beans.
    The lower figure gives the general population, the other figures give
    the pure lines within the population. (After Johannsen.)</p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

  <p>On the contrary, some of the lines would be the same.</p>

  <p>The result means that the general population is made up of definite
  kinds of individuals that may have been sorted out.</p>

  <p>That his conclusion is correct is shown by rearing a new generation
  from any plant or indeed from several plants of any one of these lines.
  Each line repeats the same modal class. There is no further breaking up
  into groups. Within the line it does not matter at all whether one
  chooses a big bean or a little one&mdash;they will give the same result.
  In a word, the germ plasm in each of these lines is pure, or homozygous,
  as we say. The differences that we find between the weights (or sizes) of
  the individual beans are due to external conditions to which they have
  been subjected.</p>

  <p>In a word, Johannsen's work shows that the frequency distribution of a
  pure line is due to factors that are extrinsic to the germ plasm. It does
  not matter then which individuals in a pure line are used to breed from,
  for they all carry the same germ plasm.</p>

  <p>We can now understand more clearly how <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span>selection acting on a
  general population brings about results in the direction of
  selection.</p>

  <p>An individual is picked out from the population in order to get a
  particular kind of germ plasm. Although the different classes of
  individuals may overlap, so that one can not always judge an individual
  from its appearance, nevertheless on the whole chance favors the picking
  out of the kind of germ plasm sought.</p>

  <p>In species with separate sexes there is the further difficulty that
  two individuals must be chosen for each mating, and superficial
  examination of them does not insure that they belong to the same
  group&mdash;their germ plasm cannot be inspected. Hence selection of
  biparental forms is a precarious process, now going forward, now
  backwards, now standing still. In time, however, the process forward is
  almost certain to take place if the selection is from a heterogeneous
  population. Johannsen's work was simplified because he started with pure
  lines. In fact, had he not done so his work would not have been
  essentially different from that of any selection experiment of a pure
  race of animals or plants. Whether Johannsen <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>realized the importance
  of the condition or not is uncertain&mdash;curiously he laid no emphasis
  on it in the first edition of his "Elemente der exakten
  Erblichkeitslehre".</p>

  <p>It has since been pointed out by Jennings and by Pearl that a race
  that reproduces by self-fertilization as does this bean, automatically
  becomes pure in all of the factors that make up its germ plasm. Since
  self-fertilization is the normal process in this bean the purity of the
  germ plasm already existed when Johannsen began to experiment.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">How Has Selection in Domesticated Animals and Plants Brought About Its Results?</span></p>

  <p>If then selection does not bring about transgressive variation in a
  general population, how can selection produce anything new? If it can not
  produce anything new, is there any other way in which selection becomes
  an agent in evolution?</p>

  <p>We can get some light on this question if we turn to what man has done
  with his domesticated animals and plants. Through selection, <!-- Page
  162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>i.e.,
  artificial selection, man has undoubtedly brought about changes as
  remarkable as any shown by wild animals and plants. We know, moreover, a
  good deal about how these changes have been wrought.</p>

  <p>(1) By crossing different wild species or by crossing wild with races
  already domesticated new combinations have been made. Parts of one
  individual have been combined with parts of others, creating new
  combinations. It is possible even that characters that are entirely new
  may be produced by the interaction of factors brought into
  recombination.</p>

  <p>(2) New characters appear from time to time in domesticated and in
  wild species. These, like the mutants in Drosophila, are fully equipped
  at the start. Since they breed true and follow Mendel's laws it is
  possible to combine them with characters of the wild type or with those
  of other mutant races.</p>

  <p>Amongst the new mutant factors there may be some whose chief effect is
  on the character that the breeder is already selecting. Such a
  modification will be likely to attract attention. Superficially it may
  appear that the <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page163"></a>{163}</span>factor for the original character has
  varied, while the truth may be that another factor has appeared that has
  modified a character already present. In fact, many or all Mendelian
  factors that affect the same organ may be said to be modifiers of each
  other's effects. Thus the factor for vermilion causes the eye to be one
  color, and the factor for eosin another color, while eosin vermilion is
  different from both. Eosin may be said to be a modifier of vermilion or
  vermilion of eosin. In general, however, it is convenient to use the term
  "modifier" for cases in which the factor causes a detectable change in a
  character already present or conspicuous.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 82. Scheme to indicate
    influence of the modifying factors, cream and whiting. Neither produces
    any effect alone but they modify other eye colors such as eosin.</p>
  </div>

  <p>One of the most interesting, and at the same time most treacherous,
  kinds of modifying factors is that which produces an effect <i>only</i>
  when some other factor is present. Thus Bridges has shown that there is a
  factor called "cream" that does not affect the red color of the eye of
  the wild fly, yet makes "eosin" much paler (fig. 82). Another factor
  "whiting" which produces no effect on red makes eosin entirely white.
  Since cream or whiting may be carried by red eyed flies without their
  presence being seen until eosin is used, the experimenter must be
  continually on the lookout for such factors which may lead to erroneous
  conclusions unless detected. As yet breeders have not realized the
  important rôle that modifiers have played in their results, but there are
  indications at least that the heaping up of modifying factors has been
  one of the ways in which <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>highly specialized domesticated animals
  have been produced. Selection has accomplished this result not by
  changing factors, but by picking up modifying factors. The demonstration
  of the presence of these factors has already been made in some cases.
  Their study promises to be one of the most instructive fields for further
  work bearing on the selection hypothesis.</p>

  <p>In addition to these well recognized methods by which artificial
  selection has produced new things we come now to a question that is the
  very crux of the selection theory today. Our whole conception of
  selection turns on the answer that we give to this matter and if I appear
  insistent and go into some detail it is because I think that the matter
  is worth very careful consideration.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Are Factors Changed Through Selection?</span></p>

  <p>As we have seen, the variation that we find from individual to
  individual is due in part to the environment; this can generally be
  demonstrated. Other differences in an <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span>ordinary population are
  recognized as due to different genetic (hereditary) combinations. No one
  will dispute this statement. But is all the variability accounted for in
  these two ways? May not a factor itself fluctuate? Is it not <i>a
  priori</i> probable that factors do fluctuate? Why, in a word, should we
  regard factors as inviolate when we see that everything else in organisms
  is more or less in amount? I do not know of any <i>a priori</i> reason
  why a factor may not fluctuate, unless it is, as I like to think, a
  chemical molecule. We are, however, dealing here not with generalities
  but with evidence, and there are three known methods by means of which it
  has been shown that variability, other than environmental or
  recombinational, is not due to variability in a factor, nor to various
  "potencies" possessed by the same factors.</p>

  <p>(1) By making the stock uniform for all of its factors&mdash;chief
  factors and modifiers alike. Any change in such a stock produced by
  selection would then be due to a change in one or more of the factors
  themselves. Johannsen's experiment is an example of this sort.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig_083a.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_083a.jpg"

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 83 a. Drosophila
    ampelophila with truncate wings.</p>
  </div>

  <p>(2) The second method is one that is <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>capable of
  <i>demonstrating</i> that the effects of selection are actually due to
  modifiers. It has been worked out in our laboratory, chiefly by Muller,
  and used in a particular case to demonstrate that selection produced its
  effect by isolating modifying factors. For example, a mutant type called
  truncate appeared, characterized by shorter wings, usually square at the
  end, (fig. 83a). The wings varied from those of normal length to wings
  much shorter (fig. 83b). For three years the mutant stock was <!-- Page
  168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>bred from
  individuals having the shorter wings until at last a stock was obtained
  in which some of the individuals had wings much shorter than the body. By
  means of linkage experiments it was shown that at least three factors
  were present that modified the wings. These were isolated by means of
  their linkage relations, and their mutual influence on the production of
  truncate wings was shown.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:32%;">
      <a href="images/fig_083b.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_083b.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 83b." title="Fig. 83b." /></a>
    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 83 b. Series of wings of
    different length shown by truncate stock of D. ampelophila.</p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span></p>

  <p>An experiment of this kind can only be carried out in a case where the
  groups of linked gens are known. At present Drosophila is the only animal
  (or plant) sufficiently well known to make this test possible, but this
  does not prove that the method is of no value. On the contrary it shows
  that any claim that factors can themselves be changed can have no
  finality until the claim can be tested out by means of the linkage test.
  For instance, bar eye (fig. 31) arose as a mutation. All our stock has
  descended from a single original mutant. But Zeleny has shown that
  selection within our stock will make the bar eye narrower or broader
  according to the direction of selection. It remains to be shown in this
  case how selection has produced its effects, and this can be done by
  utilizing the same process that was used in the case of truncate.</p>

  <p>Another mutant stock called beaded (fig. 84), has been bred for five
  years and selected for wings showing more beading. In extreme cases the
  wings have been reduced to mere stumps (see stumpy, fig. 5), but the
  stock shows great variability. It is probable here <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>as Dexter has shown,
  that a number of mutant factors that act as modifiers have been picked up
  in the course of the selection, and when it is recalled that during those
  five years over 125 new characters have appeared elsewhere it does not
  seem improbable that factors also have appeared that modify the wings of
  this stock.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 84. Two flies showing
    beaded wings.</p>
  </div>

  <p>(3) The third method is one that has been developed principally by
  East for plants; also by MacDowell for rabbits and flies. The <!-- Page
  171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>method
  does not claim to prove that modifiers are present, but it shows why
  certain results are in harmony with that expectation and can not be
  accounted for on the basis that a factor has changed. Let me give an
  example. When a Belgian hare with large body was crossed to a common
  rabbit with a small body the hybrid was intermediate in size. When the
  hybrid was crossed back to the smaller type it produced rabbits of
  various sizes in apparently a continuous series. MacDowell made
  measurements of the range of variability in the first and in the second
  generations.</p>

  <p>He found that the variability was smaller in the first generation than
  in the second <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The preceding account attempts to point out how I should prefer to
  interpret the problem of selection in the light of the most recent work
  on breeding. But I would give a very incomplete account of the whole
  situation if I neglected to include some important work which has led
  some of my fellow-workers to a very different conclusion.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/fig_088.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_088.jpg"

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 88. Scheme to show classes
    of hooded rats used by Castle. (After Castle.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Castle in particular is the champion of a view based on his results
  with hooded rats. Starting with individuals which have a narrow black
  stripe down the back he selected for a narrower stripe in one direction
  and for a <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>{177}</span>broader stripe in the other. As the
  diagram shows (fig. 88) Castle has succeeded in producing in one
  direction a race in which the dorsal stripe has disappeared and in the
  other direction a race in which the black has extended over the back and
  sides, leaving only a white mark on the belly. Neither of these extremes
  occurs, he believes, in the ordinary hooded race of domesticated rats. In
  other words no matter how many of them came under observation the extreme
  types of his experiment would not be found.</p>

  <p>Castle claims that the factor for hoodedness must be a single
  Mendelian unit, because if hooded rats are crossed to wild gray rats with
  uniform coat and their offspring are inbred there are produced in
  F<sub>2</sub> three uniform rats to one hooded rat. Castle advances the
  hypothesis that factors&mdash;by which he means Mendelian
  factors&mdash;may themselves vary in much the same way as do the
  characters that they stand for. He argues, in so many words, that since
  we judge a factor by the kind of character it produces, when the
  character varies the factor that stands for it may have changed. <!--
  Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span></p>

  <p>As early as 1903 Cuénot had carried out experiments with spotted mice
  similar to those of Castle with rats. Cuénot found that spotted crossed
  to uniform coat color gave in F<sub>2</sub> a ratio of three uniform to
  one spotted, yet selection of those spotted mice with more white in their
  coat produced mice in successive generations that had more and more
  white. Conversely Cuénot showed that selection of those spotted mice that
  had more color in their coat produced mice with more and more color and
  less white. Cuénot does not however bring up in this connection the
  question as to how selection in these spotted mice brings about its
  results.</p>

  <p>Without attempting to discuss these results at the length that they
  deserve let me briefly state why I think Castle's evidence fails to
  establish his conclusion.</p>

  <p>In the first place one of the premises may be wrong. The three to one
  ratio in F<sub>2</sub> by no means proves that all conditions of
  hoodedness are due to one factor. The result shows at most that one
  factor that gives the hooded types is a simple Mendelian factor. The
  changes in this type may be caused by modifying factors <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>that can show
  an effect only when hoodedness is itself present. That this is not an
  imaginary objection but a real one is shown by an experiment that Castle
  himself made which furnishes the ground for the second objection.</p>

  <p>Second. If the factor has really changed its potency, then if a very
  dark individual from one end of the series is crossed to a wild rat and
  the second generation raised we should expect that the hooded
  F<sub>2</sub> rats would all be dark like their dark grandparent. When
  Castle made this test he found that there were many grades of hooded rats
  in the F<sub>2</sub> progeny. They were darker, it is true, as a group
  than were the original hooded group at the beginning of the selection
  experiment, but they gave many intermediate grades. Castle attempts to
  explain this by the assumption that the factor made pure by selection
  became contaminated by its normal allelomorph in the F<sub>1</sub>
  parent, but not only does this assumption appear to beg the whole
  question, but it is in flat contradiction with what we have observed in
  hundreds of Mendelian cases where no evidence for such a contamination
  exists. <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Later Castle crossed some of the extracted rats of average grade
  (3.01) from the plus series to the same wild race and got F<sub>2</sub>
  hooded rats from this cross. These F<sub>2</sub> hooded rats did not
  further approach the ordinary range but were nearer the extreme selected
  plus hooded rats (3.33) than were the F<sub>2</sub>'s extracted from the
  first cross (2.59). Castle concludes from this that multiple factors can
  not account for the result. As a matter of fact, Castle's evidence <i>as
  published</i> does not establish his conclusion because the wild rats
  used in the second experiment may have carried plus modifiers. This could
  only be determined by suitable tests which Castle does not furnish. This
  is the crucial point, without which the evidence carries no
  conviction.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, from Castle's point of view, these latest results would
  seem to increase the difficulty of interpretation of his first
  F<sub>2</sub> extracted cross, and it is now the first result that calls
  for explanation if one accepts his later conclusion.</p>

  <p>These and other objections that might be taken up show, I think, that
  Castle's <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page181"></a>{181}</span>experiment with hooded rats fails entirely
  to establish his contention of change in potency of the germ or of
  contamination of factors, while on the contrary they are in entire accord
  with the view that he is dealing with a case of modifying factors.</p>

    (After Jennings.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Equally important are the results that Jennings has obtained with
  certain protozoa. Paramecium multiplies by dividing across in the <!--
  Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>middle, each half replacing its lacking
  part. Both the small nucleus (micronucleus) and the large nucleus
  (macronucleus) divide at each division of the body. Jennings found that
  while individuals descended from a single paramecium vary in size (fig.
  89), yet the population from a large individual is the same as the
  population derived from a small individual. In other words, selection
  produces no result and the probable explanation is, of course, that the
  different sizes of individuals are due to the environment, while the
  constancy of the type is genetic. Jennings found a number of races of
  paramecium of different sizes living under natural conditions. The
  largest individual of a small race might overlap the smallest individual
  of other larger races (fig. 89); nevertheless each kind reproduced its
  particular race. The results are like those of Johannsen in a general
  way, but differ in that reproduction takes place in paramecium by direct
  division instead of through self-fertilization as in beans, and also in
  that the paramecia were probably not homozygous. Since, however, so far
  as known no "reduction" takes place in <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>paramecium at each
  division, the genetic composition of parent and offspring should be the
  same. Whether pseudo-parthenogenesis that Woodruff and Erdmann have found
  occurring in paramecium at intervals involves a redistribution of the
  hereditary factors is not clear. Jennings's evidence seems incompatible
  with such a view.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 90. Stylonychia showing
    division into two. (After Stein.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>More recently one of Jennings's students, Middleton, has made a
  careful series of selection experiments with Stylonychia (fig. 90) in
  which he selected for lines showing more rapid <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>or slower rates of
  division. His observations seem to show that his selection separated two
  such lines that came from the same original stock. The rapidity of the
  effects of selection seems to preclude the explanation that
  pseudo-parthenogenesis has complicated the results. Nevertheless, the
  results are of such a kind as to suggest that they were due to selection
  of vegetative (somatic) differences and that no genetic change of factors
  was involved, for his conclusion that the rapidity with which the effects
  gained by long selection might be suddenly reversed when selection was
  reversed is hardly consistent with an interpretation of the results based
  on changes in the "potencies" of the factors present.</p>

  <p>Equally striking are the interesting experiments that Jennings has
  recently carried out with Difflugia (fig. 91). This protozoon secretes a
  shell about itself which has a characteristic shape, and often carries
  spines. The opening at one end of the shell through which the protoplasm
  protrudes to make the pseudopodia is surrounded by a rim having a
  characteristic pattern. The protoplasm contains <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>several nuclei and in
  addition there is scattered material or particles called chromidia that
  are supposed to be chromatic in nature and related to the material of the
  nuclei, possibly by direct interchange.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When Difflugia divides, part of the protoplasm protrudes from the
  opening and a new shell is secreted about this mass which becomes a
  daughter individual. The behavior of the nucleus and of the chromidia at
  this time is obscure, but there is some evidence that their materials may
  be irregularly distributed <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>between parent and offspring. If this is
  correct, and if in the protozoa the chromatin has the same influence that
  it seems to have in higher animals, the mode of reproduction in Difflugia
  would be expected to give little more than random sampling of the germ
  plasm.</p>

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 92. Races of Difflugia.
    (After Leidy.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Jennings was able by means of selection to get from the descendants of
  one original individual a number of different types that themselves bred
  true, except in so far as selection could affect another change in them.
  In this connection it is interesting to note that Leidy <!-- Page 187
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span>has published
  figures of Difflugia (fig. 92) that show that a great many "types" exist.
  If through sexual union (a process that occurs in Difflugia) the germ
  plasm (chromatin) of these wild types has in times past been recombined,
  then selection would be expected to separate certain types again, if, at
  division, irregular sampling of the germ plasm takes place. Until these
  points are settled the bearing of these important experiments of Jennings
  on the general problem of selection is uncertain.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">How Does Natural Selection Influence the Course of Evolution?</span></p>

  <p>The question still remains: Does selection play any rôle in evolution,
  and, if so, in what sense? Does the elimination of the unfit influence
  the course of evolution, except in the negative sense of leaving more
  room for the fit? There is something further to be said in this
  connection, although opinions may differ as to whether the following
  interpretation of the term "natural selection" is the only possible
  one.</p>

  <p>If through a mutation a character appears that is neither advantageous
  nor disadvantageous, but indifferent, the chance that it may become
  established in the race is extremely small, although by good luck such a
  thing may occur rarely. It makes no difference whether the character in
  question is a dominant or a <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>recessive one, the chance of its becoming
  established is exactly the same. If through a mutation a character
  appears that has an <i>injurious</i> effect, however slight this may be,
  it has practically no chance of becoming established.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 94. Evolution of
    elephant's trunk. (After Lull.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>If through a mutation a character appears that has a <i>beneficial</i>
  influence on the individual, the chance that the individual will survive
  is increased, not only for itself, but for all of its <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>descendants
  that come to inherit this character. It is this increase in the number of
  individuals possessing a particular character, that might have an
  influence on the course of evolution. This gives a better chance for
  improvement by several successive steps; but not because the species is
  more likely to mutate again in the same direction. An imaginary example
  will illustrate how this happens: When elephants had trunks less than a
  foot long, the chance of getting trunks more than one foot long was in
  proportion to the length of trunks already present and to the number of
  individuals; but increment in trunk length is no more likely to occur
  from an animal having a trunk more than one foot long than from an animal
  with a shorter trunk.</p>

  <p>The case is analogous to tossing pennies. At any stage in the game the
  chance of accumulating a hundred heads is in proportion to the number of
  heads already obtained, and to the number of throws still to be made. But
  the number of heads obtained has no influence on the number of heads that
  will appear in the next throw. <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p><!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span></p>

  <p>Owing then to this property of the germ plasm to duplicate itself in a
  large number of samples not only is an opportunity furnished to an
  advantageous variation to become extensively multiplied, but the presence
  of a large number of individuals of a given sort prejudices the probable
  future result.</p>

  <p>The question may be raised as to whether it is desirable to call
  selection a <i>creative</i> process. There are so many supernatural and
  mystical implications that hang around the term creative that one can not
  be too careful in stating in what sense the term is to be used. If by
  creative is meant that something is made out of nothing, then of course
  there is no need for the scientist to try to answer such a question. But
  if by a creative process is meant that something is made out of something
  else, then there are two alternatives to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>First, if it were true that selection of an individual of a certain
  kind determines that new variations in the same direction occur as a
  consequence of the selection, then selection would certainly be creative.
  How this could occur might be quite unintelligible, but of course it <!--
  Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>might
  be claimed that the point is not whether we can explain how creation
  takes place, but whether we can get verifiable evidence that such a kind
  of thing happens. This possibility is disposed of by the fact that there
  is no evidence that selection determines the direction in which variation
  occurs.</p>

  <p>Second, if you mean by a creative process that by picking out a
  certain kind of individual and multiplying its numbers a better chance is
  furnished that a certain end result will be obtained, such a process may
  be said to be creative. This is, I think, the proper use of the term
  creative in a mechanistic sense.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Conclusions</span></p>

  <p>In reviewing the evidence relating to selection I have tried to handle
  the problem as objectively as I could.</p>

  <p>The evidence shows clearly that the characters of wild animals and
  plants, as well as those of domesticated races, are inherited both in the
  wild and in the domesticated forms according to Mendel's Law.</p>

  <p>The causes of the mutations that give rise <!-- Page 194 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>to new characters we do
  not know, although we have no reason for supposing that they are due to
  other than natural processes.</p>

  <p>Evolution has taken place by the incorporation into the race of those
  mutations that are beneficial to the life and reproduction of the
  organism. Natural selection as here defined means both the increase in
  the number of individuals that results after a beneficial mutation has
  occurred (owing to the ability of living matter to propagate) and also
  that this preponderance of certain kinds of individuals in a population
  makes some further results more probable than others. More than this,
  natural selection can not mean, if factors are fixed and are not changed
  by selection.</p>
